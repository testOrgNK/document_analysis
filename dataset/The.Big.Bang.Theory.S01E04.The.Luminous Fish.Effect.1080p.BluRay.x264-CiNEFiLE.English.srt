about time travel again.

00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:08,757
Why? Did you hit a roadblock
with invisibility?

3
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:11,468
Put it on the back burner.

4
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:15,639
Anyway, it occurs to me,
if I ever did perfect a time machine...

5
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,933
...I'd go into the past
and give it to myself.

6
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:21,645
Thus eliminating the need for me
to invent it in the first place.

7
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,816
- Interesting.
- Yeah, it really takes the pressure off.

8
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:27,818
Sounds like a breakthrough.

9
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,487
Should I call Science
and tell them to hold the cover?

10
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:32,990
It's time travel, Leonard.
I will have done that.

11
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,910
I guess congratulations are in order.

12
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:41,040
No, congratulations
will have been in order.

13

I'm not going to enjoy this party.

Yes, I was there.

You know what's interesting
about caves?

- What?
- Nothing.

We'll avoid Finkleday, meet the new head,

Howard brought a date?

A more plausible explanation is that his
work in robotics has made an amazing leap.

Howard, I told you, touching's extra.

Right. Sorry.

Howard, nice to meet you. And you are?

48
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,773
An actual real scientist.

49
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,611
How was that?

50
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,574
I can't believe he fired me.

51
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:41,118
You did call him
a glorified science teacher...

52
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:45,873
...whose last successful experiment
was lighting his own farts.

53
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:50,711
In my defense, I prefaced that by saying
"with all due respect."

54
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,656
Morning.

55
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,867
You're making eggs for breakfast?

56
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,037
This isn't breakfast, it's an experiment.

57
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,582
Oh. Because it looks a lot like breakfast.

58
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,628
I finally have time to test my hypothesis
about the separation of water molecules...

59
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:36,381
...from the egg proteins
and its impact vis-à-vis taste.

60
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:39,801
Sounds yummy.

61
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,054
I look forward to your work with bacon.

62
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,056
As do I.

63
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:48,977
You know, I'm sure if you just apologize
to Gablehauser he'd give your job back.

64
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,896
I don't want my job back.

65
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,983
I've spent three and a half years
staring at grease boards full of equations.

66
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,569
Before that,
I spent four years working on my thesis.

67
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:01,907
Before that, I was in college,
and before that I was in the fifth grade.

This is my first day off in decades
and I'm going to savor it.

Okay. I'll let you get back
to fixing your eggs.

70
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,919
I'm not just fixing my eggs,

Hi, I'm running out to the market.
Do you guys need anything?

77
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:59,089
Oh. This would be
one of those circumstances...

78
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:02,801
...people unfamiliar with the law
of large numbers would call a coincidence.

- I'm sorry?
- I need eggs.

80
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,930
- Four dozen should suffice.
- Four dozen?

81

Evenly distributed amongst brown, white,
free-range, large, extra-large and jumbo.

How come
you didn't go in to work today?

86

I'm taking a sabbatical because
I won't kowtow to mediocre minds.

87
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,915
So you got canned, huh?

88
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,169
Theoretical physicists do not get canned.

89
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,087
But, yeah.

90
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,256
Maybe it's for the best.

91
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:44,509
You know, I always say, "When one door
closes, another one opens."

92
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,720
No, it doesn't.

93
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,348
Not unless the doors
are connected by relays.

94
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,933
- Or there are motion sensors involved.
- No, I meant...

95
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:56,521
Or if the first door closing creates a change
of air pressure that acts upon the second.

96
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,732
Never mind.

00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:03,070

Please, slow down.

You're not leaving

Oh, sure I am.

00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,534
No, no, let me do the math for you.

102
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,120
This car weighs, let's say, 4000 pounds.

103
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,206
Now, add 140 for me, 120 for you...

104
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,417
- One-twenty?
- Oh, I'm sorry, did I insult you?

105
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:20,420
Is your body mass
somehow tied into your self-worth?

106
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,756
Well, yeah.

107
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:23,965
Interesting.

108
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:27,511
Anyway, that gives us a total weight of,
let's say, 4400 pounds.

109
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,805
Let's say 4390.

110
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,348
Fine.

By the time we come to a stop...

114

...we'll be occupying the same space
as that Buick.

An impossibility that nature will quickly
resolve into death, mutilation and...

Hey, you wanna hear an interesting thing
about tomatoes?

123
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,473
No. No, not really.

124
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,518
Listen, didn't you say
you needed some eggs?

125
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:20,021
Yes, but anyone who knows anything
about bacterial growth...

126
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:23,150
...knows to pick up their refrigerated foods
on the way out.

127
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,111
Oh, okay, maybe you should start
heading on out, then.

128
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,364
No, this is fun.

129
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,367
The thing about tomatoes,
and I think you'll enjoy this...

130
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,787
...is they're shelved with the vegetables,
but they're technically a fruit.

131
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,205
- Hmm. Interesting.
- Isn't it?

132
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:40,041
No, I mean what you find enjoyable.

133
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,505
Oh, boy.

134
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,050
What now?

135
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,761
Well, there's some value
to taking a multivitamin...

136
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,139
...but the human body
can only absorb so much.

137
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:59,186
What you're buying here
are the ingredients for very expensive urine.

138
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,814
Well, maybe that's what I was going for.

139
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,816
Well, then you'll want some manganese.

140
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,991
Well, that was fun.

141
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,619
Tomorrow we can go
to one of those warehouse stores.

142
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:16,870
I don't know, Sheldon.

143
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:21,374
It's gonna take me a while to recover
from all the fun I had today.

144
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:25,212
Are you sure? There are a lot
of advantages to buying in bulk.

145
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,797
For example, I noticed
you purchase your tampons...

146
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,424
...one month's supply at a time.

147
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,970
- What?
- Well, think about it.

148
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,555
It doesn't spoil...

149
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:39,267
...and you're going to be needing them
for at least the next 30 years.

150
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,854
You want me to buy
30 years' worth of tampons?

151
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,105
Well, 30, 35...

152
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:47,067
- When did your mother go into menopause?
- Okay.

153
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,569
I'm not talking about this with you.

154
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:50,820
Oh, Penny.

155
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:54,908
This is a natural human process
and we're talking about significant savings.

156
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:58,787
Now, if you assume 15 tampons per cycle
in a 28-day cycle...

157
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,747
Are you fairly regular?

158
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:09,381
Okay, no warehouse store,
but we're still on for putt-putt golf, right?

160
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,056
Hey, I just ran into Penny.
She seemed upset about something.

161
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,725
I think it's her time of the month.

162
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,564
I marked the calendar
for future reference.

163
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,944
What's with the fish?

164
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,613
It's an experiment.

165
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:37,409
- What happened to your egg research?
- Oh, that was a dead end.

166
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,662
Scrambled eggs are as good
as they're ever going to be.

167
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,999
So fish.

168
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,628
I read an article about scientists
who inserted DNA from luminous jellyfish...

169
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:54,301
...into other animals, and I thought,
"Hey, fish nightlights."

170
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,013
Fish nightlights.

171
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,266
It's a billion-dollar idea. Shhh!

172
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,143
Mum's the word.

173
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:09,065
Are you sure you don't wanna just apologize
to Gablehauser and get your job back?

174
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,860
Oh, no, no, no.
No, I have too much to do.

175
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,154
Like luminous fish.

176
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:17,198
- Shhh!
- I'm sorry, I didn't...

177
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,784
That's just the beginning.

178
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:24,205
I also have an idea for a bulk,
mail-order feminine hygiene company.

179
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,791
Oh, glow-in-the-dark tampons.

180
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,880
Leonard, we're gonna be rich.

181
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:39,095
- Thanks for coming on such short notice.
- You did the right thing calling.

182
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,473
I didn't know what to do.
He's lost all focus.

183
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,476
Every day, he's got a new obsession.

184
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,234
This is a particularly disturbing one.

185
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,364
Mommy?

186
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,909
Hi, baby.

187
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,578
<font color="#E86CE4">(MOUTHING)</font>
You called my mother?

188
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,089
Oh, you got yourself a loom. How nice.

189
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:18,093
- Thank you.
- Honey, why did you get a loom?

190
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:23,682
I was working with luminous fish
and I thought, "Hey...

191
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,267
...loom."

192
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,938
Mom, what are you doing here?

193
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,523
Leonard called me.

194
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,817
I know, but why?

195
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,444
Because one of the great minds
of the 21 st century...

196
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,823
...is raising glow-in-the-dark fish
and weaving serapes.

197
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,784
This is not a serape. This is a poncho.

198
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:46,121
A serape is open at the sides,
a poncho is closed. This is a poncho.

199
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:50,417
And neither is a reason
to call someone's mother.

200
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,253
Really?
When was the last time you left the house?

201
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,505
I went to the market with Penny.

202
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,424
Yeah, that was three weeks ago.

203
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:58,633
Well, then, buckle up.

204
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:02,887
In the next four to eight days,
she's going to get very crabby.

205
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,267
Sweetheart,
your little friend is concerned about you.

206
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,727
Yes, well, I'm not a child.

207
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,980
I'm a grown man
capable of living my life as I see fit.

208
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,316
And I certainly don't need someone
telling on me to my mother.

209
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,027
Wait, where are you going?

210
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:21,239
To my room and no one's allowed in.

211
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:22,699

212
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,326
- He gets his temper from his daddy.
- Ah.

213
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,871
- He's got my eyes.
- I see.

214
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:31,583
All that science stuff,
that comes from Jesus.

215
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,421
Sheldon, your mom made dinner.

216
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,630
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>:
I'm not hungry.

217
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,717
Oh. Leonard, don't trouble yourself.
He's stubborn.

218
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,969
He may stay in there till the rapture.

219
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,806
Are we so sure that's a bad thing?

220
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,433
I love the boy to death...

221
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:52,687
...but he has been difficult
since he fell out of me at the Kmart.

222
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,065
Excuse me for being so bold...

223
00:12:56,233 --> 00:13:00,069
...but I now see where Sheldon gets
his smoldering good looks.

224
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:04,282
Oh. Honey, that ain't gonna work,
but you keep trying.

225
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,868
I made chicken.

226
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:12,040
I hope that isn't one of the animals
that you people think is magic.

227
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:20,048
You know, we have an Indian gentleman
at our church.

228
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,467
A Dr. Patel. It's a beautiful story.

229
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:27,013
The Lord spoke to him and moved him
to give us all 20 percent off on LASEK.

230
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,098
You know, those that needed it.

231
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,559
That is a lovely story.

232
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,478
Are we gonna do anything
about Sheldon?

233
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,189
Oh, we will.
You have to take your time with Sheldon.

234
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,525
His father, God rest his soul, used to say:

235
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:41,903
"Mary, you have to take your time
with Sheldon."

236
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,573
- Sounds like a wise man.
- Oh, not so wise.

237
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:48,827
He once tried to fight a bobcat
for some licorice.

238
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:55,250
So everybody grab a plate
and a pretty placemat that Shelly wove.

239
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,752
Has Shelly ever freaked out
like this before?

240
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,962
Oh, all the time.

241
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,339
I remember one summer
when he was 13...

242
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,634
...he built a small nuclear reactor
in the shed...

243
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,929
...and told everybody he was gonna provide
electricity for the town.

244
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:12,517
Well, the only problem was, he had no,
what you call, fissionable materials.

245
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:16,187
Anyway, when he went on the Internet
to get some...

246
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:20,817
...a man from the government came by
and sat him down real gentle...

247
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,779
...and told him it's against the law
to have yellow cake uranium in a shed.

248
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,324
- Well, what happened?
- Well, poor boy had a fit.

249
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:31,661
Locked himself in his room
and built a sonic death ray.

250
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,956
- A death ray?
- Well, that's what he called it.

251
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,292
Didn't even slow down the neighbor kids.
Heh.

252
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,795
It pissed our dog off to no end.

253
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,133
You know, you two make a cute couple.

No, we're not a couple. We're singles.

256
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:54,642
Two singles. Like those individually
wrapped slices of cheese that...

257
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,021
Or friends.

258
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,315
- Did I pluck a nerve there?
- Oh, yeah.

259
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:03,109
Okay.
All right, everybody, it's time to eat.

260
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:09,324
Oh, Lord, we thank you for this meal
and for all your bounty.

261
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:13,995
And we pray that you help Sheldon
get back on his rocker.

262
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:18,416
Now, after a moment of silent meditation,
I'm gonna end with "in Jesus' name"...

263
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,336
...but you two
don't feel any obligation to join in.

264
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,424
Unless, of course,
the Holy Spirit moves you.

265
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,019
Oh, my God,
this is the best cobbler I've ever had.

266
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:41,856
It was always Sheldon's favorite.
You know what the secret ingredient is?

267
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,566
- Love?
- Lard.

268
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:52,200
- Hey, look who's com...
- Shh. You'll spook him.

269
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,871
He's like a baby deer.
You gotta let him come to you.

270
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,589
This is ridiculous.

271
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,383
Damn it, Sheldon, snap out of it.

272
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:12,720
You're a physicist. You belong at the
university doing research, not in your room.

- Morning.
- Oh.

00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,618
Well, that looks awful fancy.
What is that?

279
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:42,333
It's my idea of what DNA would look like
in a silicon-based life form.

280
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:47,171
But intelligently designed
by a creator, right?

00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,258
What do you want, Mom?

282
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:54,637
You know how your daddy used to say
that you can only fish for so long...

283
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,682
...before you gotta throw
a stick of dynamite in the water?

284
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,977
- Yeah?
- Well, I'm done fishing.

285
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,605
- You put those on.
- What for?

286
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,649
Because you're gonna go
to your office...

287
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,360
...apologize to your boss
and get your job back.

- No.
- I'm sorry.

289
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:15,241
Did I start that sentence with the words
"if it please Your Highness"?

290
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,662
I'm not going to.
I didn't say anything that wasn't true.

Now, you listen here.

292
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,875
I have been telling you since you were 4.

293
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:28,004
It's okay to be smarter than everybody,
but you can't go around pointing it out.

294
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,965
- Why not?
- Because people don't like it.

295
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,094
Remember all the ass-kickings
from the neighbor kids?

Now, let's get cracking.

00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,978
Shower, shirt, shoes and let's shove off.

with two other children...

303
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,000
...who are dumb as soup.

304
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,883
Excuse me, Dr. Gablehauser,
are you busy?

305
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:18,054
- Well, actually...
- Sheldon, he's just doodling. Get in here.

306
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,184
- Dr. Gablehauser.
- Dr. Cooper.

307
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,021
Let's go, baby, we're losing daylight.

308
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,192
Um...

309
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,530
As you know, several weeks ago
in our first encounter...

310
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,907
...we may have gotten off
on the wrong foot...

311
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,617
...when I called you an idiot.

312
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:43,454
And I just wanted to say
that I was wrong...

313
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,415
...to point it out.

314
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,961
I'm sorry, we haven't been introduced.

315
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,548
- Dr. Eric Gablehauser.
- Mary Cooper, Sheldon's mom.

316
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:57,009
Now, that's impossible. You must've
had him when you were a teenager.

317
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,512
Oh, aren't you sweet. His father's dead.

318
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,267
- Recently?
- Long enough.

319
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,019
Please.

320
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,397
Sheldon, shouldn't you be working?

321
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,945
Okay.

322
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,617
Hey, how did it go?

323
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,578
I got my job back.

324
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,913
Really? What happened?

325
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,583
I'm not quite sure.

326
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:33,337
It involves a part of the human experience
that has always eluded me.

327
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,132
Well, that narrows it down.

328
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:43,764
I'm very proud of you, honey.
You showed a lot of courage today.

329
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,225
Thanks, Mom.

330
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,230
- Mom?
- Mm-hm.

331
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:56,068
Is Dr. Gablehauser
going to be my new daddy?

332
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:02,116
We'll see. Sleep tight.
