...on the other side of that gate
guarding the Sword of Azeroth.

Oh, right, right, right.

Stealing snail mail, very old school.

Oh, sorry.

Oh, no, that's probably

Penny for your thoughts.

- What's the matter?
- No, I'm fine.

Penny's fine,
the guy she's kissing is really fine.

Kissing? What kind of kissing?
Cheeks, lips, chase, French?

What is wrong with you?

65
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,932
I'm a romantic.

66
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,894
Don't tell me
that your hopeless infatuation...

67
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,979
...is devolving into pointless jealousy.

68
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:53,982
No, I'm not jealous.
I'm just a little concerned for her.

69
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,235
Didn't like the look of the guy
she was with.

70
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,195
Because he looks better than you?

71
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,906
Yeah.

72
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,450
He was kind of dreamy.

73
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,161
At least now
you can retrieve the black box...

74
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,831
...from the smoldering wreckage
that was once your fantasy of dating her...

75
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:13,835
...and analyze the data so that
you don't crash into geek mountain again.

76
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:19,216
I disagree. Love is not a sprint.
It's a marathon.

77
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:24,346
A relentless pursuit that only ends
when she falls into your arms...

78
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,474
...or hits you with the pepper spray.

79
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,351
No, I'm done with Penny.

80
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,854
I'm gonna be more realistic
and go after someone my own speed.

81
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,107
- Like who?
- I don't know.

82
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,316
Olivia Geiger?

83
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:40,362
The dietitian at the cafeteria
with the limp and the lazy eye?

84
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,408
- Yeah.
- Well, I don't think you have a shot there.

85
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,037
I have noticed that Leslie Winkle
recently started shaving her legs.

86
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:52,291
Now, given that winter is coming,
one can assume she's signaling...

87
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,667
...sexual availability.

88
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,545
I don't know.
You guys work in the same lab.

89
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:59,047
- So?
- There are pitfalls.

90
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,716
Trust me, I know.

91
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:04,011
When it comes
to sexual-harassment law...

92
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:07,139
...I'm a bit of a self-taught expert.

93
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:12,019
Howard, if I were to ask Leslie Winkle out,
it would just be for dinner.

94
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:16,023
I'm not gonna walk into the lab,
ask her to strip naked and dance for me.

95
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,442
Oh, then you're probably okay.

96
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,114
- Hello, Leslie.
- Hi, Leonard.

97
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,408
- I'd like to propose an experiment...
- Goggles.

98
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,868
Right.

99
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,998
- I would like to propose an experiment.
- Hang on.

100
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,543
I'm trying to see how long it takes
a 500-kilowatt oxygen-iodine laser...

101
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,837
...to heat up my cup of noodles.

102
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:42,758
I've done it.
About two seconds, 2.6 for minestrone.

<font color="#E86CE4">(MACHINE WHIRRING)</font>

104
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,726
Anyway, I was thinking more
of a biosocial exploration...

105
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,770
...with a neurochemical overlay.

106
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,774
Wait, are you asking me out?

107
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,110
I was going to characterize it
as the modification...

108
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:06,406
...of our colleague/friendship paradigm
with the addition of a date-like component.

109
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:10,410
But we don't need to quibble
over terminology.

110
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,454
What sort of experiment
would you propose?

111
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,165
There is a generally accepted
pattern in this area.

112
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,585
I pick you up, take you to a restaurant,
then we would see a movie.

113
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,088
Probably a romantic comedy
featuring the talents...

114
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,340
...of Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock.

115
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,008
Interesting.

116
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,761
And would you agree
the primary way we would evaluate...

117
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:31,807
...the success or failure of the date would
be based on the biochemical reaction...

118
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:35,394
- ...during the good-night kiss?
- Heart rate, pheromones, et cetera, yes.

119
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,021
Why don't we stipulate
the date goes well...

120
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,981
...and move to the key variable?

121
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,858
- You mean kiss you now?
- Yes.

122
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:45,112
- Define the parameters of the kiss.
- Closed mouth, but romantic.

123
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,030
- Mint?
- Thank you.

Fair enough.

129
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:15,100
On the plus side, it was a good kiss,
reasonable technique...

130
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,852
...no extraneous spittle.

131

On the other hand, no arousal.

Well, thank you for your time.

- Hmm.

None at all?

Sheldon, if you were a robot
and I knew and you didn't...

138
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:50,093
...would you want me to tell you?

139
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,054
That depends.

140
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:58,894
When I learn that I'm a robot,
will I be able to handle it?

141
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:04,191
Maybe, although the history
of science fiction is not on your side.

142
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,735
Okay. Uh, let me ask you this.

143
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,112
When I learn that I'm a robot...

144
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,033
...would I be bound by
Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics?

145
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:17,454
You might be bound by them right now.

146
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,249
That's true.

147
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:25,879
- Have you ever harmed a human being?
- Of course not.

148
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:29,257
Have you ever harmed yourself,
except in cases where a human being...

149
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,092
...would have been endangered?

150
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,762
- Well, no.
- I smell robot.

151

- Hey, what's going on?
- Internet's been down for half an hour.

152
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,232
Also, Sheldon may be a robot.

153
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,861
So how did it go with Leslie?

154
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:54,366
Oh, we tried kissing,
but the Earth didn't move.

155
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:58,954
I mean, any more than the 383 miles
that it was gonna move anyway.

156
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,916
Oh, I've seen that look before.

157
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:06,461
This is just gonna be two weeks
of moping and tedious emo songs...

158
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:10,090
...and calling me to come down
to pet stores to look at cats.

159
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,635
I don't know if I can take it.

160
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,471
You could power down.

161
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:22,519
Well, as usual,
Wolowitz has the solution.

162
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,356
I happen to know a place
where there are plenty of eligible women...

163
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,316
...and Leonard could have his pick.

Remember the Latin hips.

166
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:43,373
Shoulders stay still and we sway.

167
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,922
One, two, three.

Five, six, seven.

I think Mrs. Tishman's
got her eye on you.

00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,056
I've been there. You're in for a treat.

She said, "You don't know me

00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:13,862
You don't even care"

173
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,114
Oh, yeah

174
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,324
Oh, good Lord.

175
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:20,827
She said, "You don't know me

You don't wear my chains"

177

Oh, yeah

God, that's a good song.

179
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:33,840
If you're compiling a mix CD
for a double suicide.

Oh, I hope that scratching post
is for you.

181
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:41,348
I know what you're thinking.
I've taken your asthma into account.

182
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,516
There's a feline geneticist in San Diego...

183
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:46,728
...who's developed
the cutest little hypoallergenic calicos.

184
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,772
- Listen...
- I've been thinking about names.

185
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:53,443
I'm kind of torn between Einstein,
Newton and Sergeant Fuzzy Boots.

186
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:56,738
Do you think you can satisfy
your need for a relationship...

187
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,115
...with a genetically altered cat?

188
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:03,119
Maybe, if it's a cute little cuddly cat.

189
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,830
Oh, come on, Leonard...

190
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,292
This is obviously about Penny.

191
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:12,962
It doesn't matter.

192
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:16,049
The woman's not interested in me.
The woman rejected me.

193
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,593
Okay, look. Ahem.

194
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:22,764
You have as much of a chance of having
a sexual relationship with Penny...

195
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,516
...as the Hubble telescope does...

196
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,810
...of discovering
at the center of every black hole...

197
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:30,188
...is a little man with a flashlight
searching for a circuit breaker.

198
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:37,570
Nevertheless, I do feel obligated
to point out to you...

199
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,781
...that she did not reject you.

200
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,866
You did not ask her out.

201
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,828
You're right.

202
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,080
I didn't ask her. I should ask her out.

203
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,457
No, no. Now, that was not my point.

204
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,836
My point was, don't buy a cat.

205
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,963
No, but you're right.

206
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,340
I should march over there
and ask her out.

207
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,927
Oh, goody, we're getting a cat.

208
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,806
Oh, yeah... No.

209
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,019
- Oh, hey, Leonard.
- Good afternoon, Penny.

210
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,564
So, hi, hey. Uh...

211
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,692
I was wondering
if you had plans for dinner.

212
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,235
Uh, you mean, dinner tonight?

213
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,322
There is an inherent ambiguity
in the word "dinner."

214
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,325
Technically,
it refers to the largest meal of the day.

215
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:27,036
So to clarify here,
by dinner, I mean supper.

216
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,205
- Supper?
- Or dinner, you know.

217
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,126
I was thinking 6:30 if you can go,
or a different time.

218
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,461
Uh, 6:30 is great.

219
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,087
Really?

220
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,216
- Great.
- Yeah, I like hanging out with you guys.

221
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:41,426
Us guys?

222
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,471
Oh, you know, Sheldon, Howard, Raj.
Who all is coming?

223
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:46,931
They...

224
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,059
...might all be there.

225
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,897
Or a subset of them might be there.

226
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,357
Algebraically speaking,
there are too many unknowns.

227
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,526
For example,
Sheldon had Quizno's for lunch.

228
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,237
Sometimes he finds that filling,
other times he doesn't.

229
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:04,699
It's no fault of Quizno's.
They have a varied menu.

230
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,911
Okay, whatever, it sounds like fun.

231
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,038
Great.

232
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,706
- Did we say a time?
- Six-thirty.

233
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:12,916
Still good?

234
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,709
- It's fine.
- It's not carved in stone.

235
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,169
No. Six-thirty is great.

236
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,421
I'll get my chisel. Heh-heh.

237
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,132
Why?

238
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:27,222
To carve the...
Okay, I'll see you at 6:30.

239
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,692
How do I look?

240
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,949
Could you be more specific?

241
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,078
Can you tell I'm perspiring a little?

242
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:55,333
No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns
under your arms conceal it nicely.

243
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,379
- What time is your date?
- Six-thirty.

244
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,923
Perfect, that gives you
two hours and 15 minutes...

245
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,301
...for that dense molecular cloud
of Aramis to dissipate.

246
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,639
- Is it too much?
- Not if you're a rugby team.

247
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:14,269
By the way, you didn't join us
because you stuffed yourself...

248
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,646
...with a chicken-carbonara sub
at Quizno's.

249
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,231
Why would I join you?

250
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,733
No reason.

251
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,572
Oh, you know what?
Maybe this isn't such a good idea.

252
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,116
Oh, no, well, now,
there's always the possibility...

253
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,493
...that alcohol and poor judgment
on her part...

254
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,037
...might lead to a nice romantic evening.

255
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,834
You're right. Alcohol, poor judgment.
It could go well.

256
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,504
Of course, there's the other possibility
that this day kicks off...

257
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,757
...an unpleasant six months of you
passing awkwardly in the hall...

258
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,802
...until one of you breaks down
and moves to another zip code.

259
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,264
You could have stopped at,
"It could go well."

260
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,892
If I could have, I would have.

261
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,895
I mean, I'm a perfectly nice guy.
There's no reason...

262
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,856
...we couldn't go to the restaurant
and have a lovely dinner.

263
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:04,652
Maybe take a walk afterwards,
talk about things we have in common.

264
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,655
"You love pottery? I love pottery."

265
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,700
You know, there's a pause.
We both know what's happening.

266
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,827
We kiss. It's a little tentative at first.

267
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,997
But I realize, she's kissing me back,
she's biting my lower lip.

268
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,333
She wants me.
This thing is going the distance.

269
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,501
We're gonna have sex.
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

270
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,840
Is the sex starting now?

271
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:27,884
I'm having a panic attack.

272
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:31,387
Oh, okay. Well, then, calm down.

273
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,431
If I could,
I wouldn't be having an attack.

274
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,017
- That's why they call it a panic attack.
- All right.

275
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,727
Would you just sit down?

276
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,480
- Yeah, sit down. Now close your eyes.
- Why?

277
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,856
- Just do it.
- Okay.

278
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:45,026
Now, try to increase
your alpha-wave activity.

279
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,946
- What?
- It's a biofeedback technique.

280
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,239
It's relaxation
through brainwave manipulation.

281
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,575
I read it
in the Journal of American Neuroscience.

282
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,453
It was sparsely sourced,
but I think the science is valid.

283
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,206
I probably have it here somewhere.

284
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,500
Who am I kidding?
I can't go through with this.

285
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,377
- You need to call her and cancel.
- Me?

286
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,087
- Yes.
- What should I tell her?

287
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,673
- I don't know. Tell her I'm sick.
- Okay.

288
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,384
Not the kind that would make her
wanna take care of me.

289
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:13,763
But nothing so critical that she'll feel
uncomfortable if I wanna try this again.

290
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,432
Got it. So I'm assuming nothing venereal.

291
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,690
I'll just tell her that you had
a routine colonoscopy...

292
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,692
...and haven't quite bounced back.

293
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,236
- Give me the phone.
- I thought you wanted to cancel.

294
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,239
I can't. If I don't show up,
she'll still be expecting you.

295
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,783
Why would she be expecting me?

296
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:38,830
Stop asking me all these questions.
I need to take another shower.

297
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,752
- Are the rest of the guys meeting us here?
- Oh, yeah.

298
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,254
No.

299
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,840
Turns out that Raj and Howard
had to work...

300
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:54,470
...and Sheldon had a colonoscopy,
and he hasn't quite bounced back yet.

301
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,724
Ooh, my uncle just had
a colonoscopy.

302
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:01,978
You're kidding. Well, then,
that's something we have in common.

303
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,230
How?

304
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:10,903
We both have people in our lives
who wanna nip intestinal polyps in the bud.

305
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,870
So, what's new in the world of physics?

306
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,539
Nothing.

307
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,958
Really? Nothing?

308
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:29,630
Well, with the exception of string theory,
not much has happened since the 1930s...

309
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,507
...and you can't prove string theory.

310
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:37,138
At best you can say, "Hey, look, my idea
has an internal logical consistency."

311
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:41,934
Ah. Well, I'm sure things will pick up.

312
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,024
What's new at the Cheesecake Factory?

313
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,651
Oh, uh, not much.

314
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:55,198
Oh, we do have a chocolate key lime
that's moving pretty well.

315
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:58,826
Good.

316
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:05,917
Uh, what about
your, uh, hallway friend?

317
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:10,505
Doug? Oh, yeah. I don't know. I mean,
you know, he's nice and funny, but...

318
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,924
- Can I get you started with some drinks?
- No. Bzzz.

319
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,344
- You were saying, "But..."?
- I'd like a drink.

320
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,764
Just say the "but" thing about Doug,
and then I'll get her back.

321
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:23,184
Okay, well, it...
I don't know. It's just me.

322
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,520
I'm still getting over this break-up
with Kurt.

323
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:28,523
And this thing with Doug
would just be rebound sex.

324
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:33,277
Ugh. Don't get me started
on rebound sex.

325
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,113
It's just... It's my pattern.

326
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,490
I break up, then I find some cute guy...

327
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:41,369
...and then it's just
36 meaningless hours of...

328
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,787
Well, you know.

329
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,249
I'm not sure that I do. Um...

330
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:52,421
Is that one 36-hour experience
or is that 36 hours spread out over...

331
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:56,050
...say, one glorious summer?

332
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,718
No. It's usually over a weekend.

333
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,638
And trust me,
you do not feel good after it.

334
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,224
Well, chafing, right?

335
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,476
Emotionally.

336
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,563
Of course, yeah. Emotional chafing.

337
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,780
Hey, do you wanna see something cool?

338
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:23,411
I can make this olive go into this glass
without touching it.

339
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,289
- How?
- Physics.

340
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,796
Wow, centrifugal force.

341
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:37,258
Actually, it's centripetal force,
which is an inward force...

342
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,761
...generated by the glass
acting on the olive. Ooh.

343
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,847
Excuse me.

344
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,142
Now, if you were biting on the olive...

345
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,854
...you'd be in a non-inertial
reference frame and would...

346
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,442
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

347
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,652
Did you spill ketchup?

348
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,155
- No.
- I'm not okay.

349
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,160
You don't wanna go
to the emergency room?

350
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,369
No, no. I'm okay.

351
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:06,954
It stopped bleeding.

352
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:10,082
Anyway, you did throw up.
Isn't that a sign of a concussion?

353
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,502
Yes, but I get carsick too, so...

354
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,712
Okay.

355
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,589
Sorry about your car, by the way.

356
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:20,384
Oh, no, it's fine.
You got most of it out the window.

357
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,887
The poor guy on the bike.

358
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,641
I had a nice time.

359
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,768
Yeah, me too.

360
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,145
Well, um, good night.

361
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,189
Good night.

362
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,816
- Leonard.
- Yeah?

363
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,819
Was this supposed to be a date?

364
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,322
This?

365
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,908
No.

366
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,160
No, of course not.

367
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:49,580
This was just you and me hanging out
with guys who didn't show up...

368
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,875
...because of work and a colonoscopy.

369
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,670
Okay. I was just checking.

370
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,300
When I take a girl on a date...
And I do, heh.

371
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,637
...she knows she's been dated.

372
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,349
Capital D. Heh.

373
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:13,312
Bold face, underlined, like, dated.

374
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,108
I think I might have a concussion.
I'm gonna go lay down.

375
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,693
Good night.

376
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:25,658
- So how was your date?
- Awesome. Heh.

377
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:32,873
Score one for liquor and poor judgment.
