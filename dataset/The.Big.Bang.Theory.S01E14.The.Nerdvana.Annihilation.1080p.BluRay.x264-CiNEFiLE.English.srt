1
00:00:02,752 --> 00:00:06,296
Well, this sandwich
is an unmitigated disaster.

2
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:08,132
I asked for turkey and roast beef...

3
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:10,968
- ...with lettuce and Swiss on whole wheat.
- What'd they give you?

4
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:14,972
Turkey and roast beef
with Swiss and lettuce on whole wheat.

5
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:23,939
It's the right ingredients
but in the wrong order.

6
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,859
In a proper sandwich,
the cheese is adjacent to the bread...

7
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,320
...to create a moisture barrier
against the lettuce.

8
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:34,116
They might as well have dragged this thing
through a car wash.

9
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:37,995
- I don't believe it.
- I know. It's basic culinary science.

10
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:41,123
Some guy is auctioning off
a miniature time-machine prop...

11
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,709
...from the original film
and no one is bidding.

12
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,628
A time machine
from the movie The Time Machine?

13
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:49,965
No, a time machine
from Sophie's Choice.

14
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,968
Boy, Sophie could have used
a time machine in that movie.

15
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,345
Did you see it? It's rough.

16
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,057
<font color="#808080">HOWARD</font>: Oh, that's cool.
<font color="#808080">LEONARD</font>: Uh-huh.

17
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,642
- It's only $800?
- Yeah. And that's my bid.

18
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,562
- You bid $800?
- It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.

19
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,357
I figured it would go for thousands,
and I just wanted to be a part of it.

20
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:10,652
- There's only 30 seconds left in the auction.
- Do you have $800?

21
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,031
- Not to blow on a miniature time machine.
- Don't worry.

22
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:17,576
People wait until the last second,
then they get it. It's called sniping.

23
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:21,371
- Fifteen seconds.
- Come on, snipers.

24
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:25,709
- Ten, nine, eight...
- Where are your snipers?

25
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:27,503
- Five.
- Snipe.

26
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,670
- Four.
- Snipe.

27
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,881
- Three, two.
- Snipe, snipe.

28
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,257
- One.
- Ah!

29
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:38,138
Oh. Congratulations, you are the proud
owner of a miniature time machine.

30
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,932
- You lucky duck.
<font color="#808080">LEONARD</font>: Heh.

31
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,558
I wonder why no one else bid.

32
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:44,186
This is a classic piece
of sci-fi movie memorabilia.

33
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,438
I know. But I still can't afford it.

34
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,149
Why don't we share it?
We'll each put in 200 bucks...

35
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:52,986
- ...and take turns having it in our house.
- A time-share time machine.

36
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:57,407
- I'm in. Sheldon?
- Wha...? Need you ask?

37
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,868
But I still don't understand
why no one else bid.

38
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,922
I understand why no one else bid.

39
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,578
Did the listing actually say "miniature"?

40
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,582
I just assumed.

41
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:51,587
Well, who sells a full-sized time machine
for $800?

42
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:54,423
In a Venn diagram,
that would be an individual located...

43
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,426
...within the intersection of
"no longer want time machine"...

44
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,262
...and "need $800."

45
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,598
It's actually a tremendous bargain.

46
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:07,019
Even with shipping,
it works out to less than $4 a pound.

47
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,730
Cocktail shrimp are 12.50.

48
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:14,484
How are we gonna get it upstairs?

49
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,821
If we take the dish off,
it might fit in the elevator.

50
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,490
Yes, but the elevator's been broken
for two years.

51
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:24,369
I've been meaning to ask you, do you think
we should make a call about that?

52
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:28,790
Not necessary.
I have a Master's in engineering.

53
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,835
I remotely repair satellites
on a regular basis.

54
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:35,464
I troubleshoot space-shuttle payloads.

55
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,883
When the Mars rover
started pulling to the left...

56
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:43,764
...I performed a front-end alignment
from 62 million miles away.

57
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,983
No, that baby's broken.

Take a break, guys.

67
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:26,515
- What are you doing?
- Just moving something upstairs.

68
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:31,186
- What is it?
- Just, you know, a time machine.

69
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,730
Okay, neat.
But I really gotta get to work.

70
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,858
- Just give us a few minutes.
- I'm running really late.

71
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,402
Then I have a simple solution.

72
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,571
Go up to the roof, hop over
to the next building... There's a gap.

73
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:45,534
Don't look down if you're subject
to vertigo... and use their stairwell.

74
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:49,997
- You're joking, right?
- Oh, I never joke when it comes to vertigo.

75
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,001
Damn. Okay, I'll just take the roof.

76
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,378
If you wait for us
to set up the time machine...

77
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,714
...I can drop you off at work yesterday.

78
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,968
Time-travel joke. It's not... Never mind.

79
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,723
For what it's worth,
I thought it was humorous.

<font color="#E86CE4">(CHORTLES)</font>

81
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,894

- You guys ready to push?
<font color="#808080">RAJESH</font>: In a minute.

83
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:18,400
Howard stepped outside to throw up.

84
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:27,743
I don't know what you were worried about.
I think it really works in the room.

85
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:32,122
Yeah. It is by far the coolest thing
I have ever owned.

86
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,250
The exact time machine
that carried actor Rod Taylor...

87
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:38,253
...from Victorian England
into the post-apocalyptic future...

88
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,672
...where society had splintered
into two factions:

89
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,215
the subterranean Morlocks...

90
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:46,428
...who survived by feasting on the flesh
of the gentle surface-dwelling Eloi.

91
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:51,600
Talk about your chick magnets.

92
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,687
Oh, yeah. The guy who lives next to me
is always like:

93
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:59,316
"I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony.
I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony."

94
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:03,445
But wait until I tell him
I've got a time machine on my balcony.

95
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,908
Stuff that in your Speedos, Jacuzzi Bob.

96
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,285
Gentlemen, we said we'd take turns...

97
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,997
...but I think you'll agree
that practicality dictates it remain here.

98
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,458
You can't keep it.
What if I meet a girl and say:

99
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,336
"You wanna see my time machine?
It's at my friend's house."

100
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,630
How lame is that?

101
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,340
- He's got a point.
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>: All right.

102
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:27,135
We're going to need some ground rules.
"No shoes in the time machine."

103
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,805
"No eating in the time machine."
I propose that we add:

104
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:33,725
"Pants must be worn at all times
in the time machine."

105
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,811
Seconded.

106
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,647
I was gonna put down a towel.

107
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:45,737
I still want it on my balcony.
I say we move it on a bimonthly basis.

108
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,865
- That sounds fair.
- Hold on. Bimonthly is an ambiguous term.

109
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,660
- Every other month or twice a month?
- Twice a month.

110
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,829
- Then no.
- Okay, every other month.

111
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,539
No.

112
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,749
Sheldon, you can't be selfish.

113
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,252
We all paid for it,
so it belongs to all of us.

114
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,380
Now get out of the way
so I can sit in my time machine.

- So when it's your turn, you can.

119
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:28,196
If we all go back to the same time,
Bell's lab's going to get very crowded.

120
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,365
He'll know something's up.

121
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,701
Since the time machine
doesn't move in space...

122

- ...you'll end up in 1876 Pasadena.
- Even if you make it to Boston...

123
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:39,708
...what are you gonna do? Knock and say
to Mrs. Bell, "Fan of your husband.

124
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,711
Can I come in and watch him
invent the telephone?"

125
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,714
Mrs. Bell was deaf.
She's not even gonna hear you knock.

126

I have a solution.
First, go into the future...

127

- ...and obtain a cloaking device.
- Ooh. How far into the future?

128
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,891
If I remember, Kirk will steal
a cloaking device from the Romulans...

129
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:58,185
...on stardate 5027.3...

130

by pre-Federation reckoning.

for January 10th, 2328.

By the time I got to work,
they'd given my shift away.

147
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,466
Yeah, that's right.
I've lost an entire day's pay thanks to this.

148
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,301
- This...
- Time machine.

149
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,598
The lights flash and the dish spins.
Wanna try?

150
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,058
No.

151
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,229
I don't wanna try it.
My God, you are grown men.

152
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,107
How can you waste your lives
with these stupid toys...

153
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:30,193
...and costumes and comic books,
and now that?

154
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:33,738
- That...
- Again, time machine.

155
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,576
Oh, please, it's not a time machine.
If anything, it looks like...

156
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,662
...something Elton John would drive
through the Everglades.

157
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,336
It only moves in time.

158
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:51,840
It would be worse than useless
in a swamp.

159
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:01,099
Pathetic. All of you, completely pathetic.

160
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,272
My turn.

161
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,291
Leonard, it's 2 in the morning.

162
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:30,170
- So?
- So it's my turn.

163
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,217
Why'd you set it
for the day before yesterday?

164
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:39,929
Because I wanna go back and keep myself
from getting a time machine.

165
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:43,433
You can't. If you were to prevent yourself
from buying it in the past...

166
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,686
...you would not have it available
to stop yourself from buying it.

167
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:51,066
Ergo, you would still have it.
This is a classic rookie time-travel mistake.

168
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:57,155
Can I go back and prevent you
from explaining that to me?

169
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,698
Same paradox.

170
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,743
If you were to travel back in time
and knock me unconscious...

171
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,204
...you wouldn't have the conversation
that irritated you...

172
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,998
...motivating you to go back
and knock me unconscious.

173
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,669
What if I knocked you unconscious
right now?

174
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,255
It won't change the past.

175
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,176
But it'd make the present so much nicer.

176
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,638
Are you upset about something?

177
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,765
What was your first clue?

178
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:27,310
Well, it was a number of things.
First, the late hour.

179
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,354
Then your demeanor
seems very low-energy.

180
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,356
- Plus your irritability...
- Yes, I'm upset.

181
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,565
Oh.

182
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,527
I don't usually pick up on those things.

183
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,320
Good for me.

184
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:40,949
Yeah, good for you.

185
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,201
Oh, wait.

186
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:47,414
Did you wanna talk about
what's bothering you?

187
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,459
- I don't know. Maybe.
- Wow, I'm on fire tonight.

188
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,550
Well, here's the thing.

189
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:02,804
Girls like Penny never end up with guys
who own time machines.

190
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,389
I disagree.

191
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,850
Your inability
to successfully woo Penny...

192
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:10,228
...long predates your acquisition
of the time machine.

193
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,983
That failure clearly stands on its own.

194
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:19,112
- Thanks for pointing it out.
- In addition, your premise is flawed.

195
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,157
In the original film,
Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimieux...

196
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,742
...with that time machine.

197
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,619
In Back to the Future,
Marty McFly got to hook up...

198
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:29,581
...with his extremely attractive
young mother.

199
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,711
- Those are movies.
- Of course they're movies.

200
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:39,382
Are you expecting an example
involving a real-life time machine?

201
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,178
That's absurd.

Take a break, guys.

207
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:00,361
What are you doing?

208
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:04,199
Oh, you know,
just moving a time machine.

209
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,327
Yeah, okay, neat.
But I really gotta get to work.

210
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,245
No problem.

211
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,753
Hang on.

212
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,631
But what about your time machine?

213
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,884
Some things are more important
than toys.

214
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,560
I'm scared.

215
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,896
Don't worry, baby, I've got you.

216
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,398
Oh, Leonard.

217
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,545
It's still my turn.

218
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,760
What are you doing?

219
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,971
I'm packing up all my collectibles...

220
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:10,598
...and taking them down
to the comic-book store to sell.

221
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,934
Is that really necessary?

222
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:16,187
If you need money,
you can always sell blood.

223
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,315
And semen.

224
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,192
It's not about money.

225
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,444
We brought food.

226
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:26,656
Lox and bagels,
the breakfast of time travelers.

227
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,492
Terrific. Anyone wanna buy
my share of the time machine?

228
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,619
- Why?
- Because I don't want it anymore.

229
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,205
- Why?
- Just personal reasons.

230
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,417
My Spidey sense tells me
this has something to do with Penny.

231
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,128
Look, do you wanna buy me out or not?

232
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:44,132
I'll give you $100, which will make me
half-owner, and we'll put it on my balcony.

233
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,135
Screw his balcony.
I'll give you 120 and put it in my garage.

234
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:50,763
- I paid $200 for my share.
- Everybody knows a time machine loses...

235
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:54,017
...half its value the minute
you drive it off the lot.

236
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,103
I'll go for 200.
That time machine stays right where it is.

237
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:00,857
Three hundred. And I'll throw in my original
1979 Mattel Millennium Falcon...

238
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,901
...with real light-speed sound effects.

239
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:07,780
No. No more toys or action figures
or props or replicas...

240
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:11,326
...or costumes or robots
or Darth Vader voice changers.

241
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,411
I'm getting rid of all of it.

242
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,622
You can't do that.
Look what you've created.

243
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,207
It's like Nerdvana.

244
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:24,088
More importantly,
you have a Darth Vader voice changer?

245
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,551
- Not for long.
- I call dibs on the Golden Age Flash.

246
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,721
I need that to complete
my Justice Society of America collection.

247
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,181
- I called dibs.
- You can't.

248
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,225
I can and I did.
Look up "dibs" in Wikipedia.

249
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,937
Dibs doesn't apply in a bidding war.

250
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,857
It's not a bidding war. I'm selling it all
to Larry down at the comic-book store.

251
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,985
- Why Larry? Did Larry call dibs?
- Will you forget dibs?

252
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,529
He offered me a fair price
for the whole collection.

253
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:52,992
- What's the number? I'll match it.
- I'll match it, plus 1000 rupees.

254
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,829
- What's the exchange rate?
- None of your business. Take it or leave it.

255
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,540
Mom, my bar mitzvah bonds,
how much do I got?

256
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:03,670
Thanks. I can go $2600
and two trees in Israel.

257
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:09,258
Forget it. Guys, if I sell to one of you,
the other two are gonna be mad at me.

258
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:12,387
Who cares? As long as you pick me.

259
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,639
Okay, Leonard, put down the box.
Let's talk.

260
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,975
Sorry, Raj, my mind is made up.

261
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,395
No. I can't let you do this.

262
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:23,690
Sheldon, get out of my way.

263
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,695
None shall pass.

264
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,241
Okay.

265
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,951
I did not wanna do this...

266
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,204
...but I have here the rare,
mint-condition, production-era...

267
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:41,916
...Star Trek: The Next Generation
Geordi La Forge without his VISOR...

268
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,459
...in the original packaging.

269
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,462
If you do not get out of my way...

270
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,464
...I will open it.

271
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,300
Okay, man, be cool.

272
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,678
We're all friends here.

273
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,556
What the hell's going on?

274
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,350
- You hypocrite.
- What?

275
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,020
Little Miss Grown-Ups-
Don't-Play-With-Toys.

276
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:05,732
If I went into that apartment right now,
would I not find Beanie Babies?

277
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:08,776
Are you not an accumulator
of Care Bears and My Little Ponies?

278
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,863
And who is that Japanese feline
I see frolicking on your shorts?

279
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,574
Hello, Hello Kitty.

280
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,621
Okay, okay, look,
if this is about yesterday, Leonard...

281
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:23,541
...I am really sorry about what I said.
I was just upset.

282
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,461
- No, I needed to hear it.
- You didn't. You are a great guy.

283
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:29,797
And it is the things you love
that make you who you are.

284
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,384
I guess that makes me large breasts.

285
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,807
Still, I think it's time for me
to get rid of this stuff...

286
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,810
...and, you know, move on with my life.

287
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,646
- Really?
- Yeah.

288
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,148
Oh. Wow.

289
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,067
Good for you.

290
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,152
Thanks.

Hey, do you wanna,
I don't know, later...?

292
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,699
Excuse me.

293
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,367
- Hey, Penny.
- Hi, Mike.

294
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,411
- You ready to go?
- I just have to change.

295
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,331
- I'll give you a hand.
- Oh, stop it.

296
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,166
Bye, guys.

00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,798
My turn on the time machine.

299
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,157
It worked.

300
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,410
It really worked.

301
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:45,581
They said I was mad, but it worked.

302
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,549
Oh, no, not Morlocks.

303
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:57,343
Not flesh-eating Morlocks.

304
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:01,055
Help!

305
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,559

00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,897
Sheldon, are you okay?

307
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,817
We have to get rid of the time machine.

308
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,403
It is a little big for the living room,
isn't it?

309
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,739
Yeah, that's the problem. It's too big.

310
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,951
I'm glad you agree.
I hired some guys to help us move it.

311
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,078
Come on in, fellas.

312
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,125
Oh, no, Morlocks.

313
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,085
Eat him, eat him.
