00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,779
Thank you.

152
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,740
Okay, Raj, what'll it be?

153
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,534
<font color="#E86CE4">(WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)</font>

154
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,869
Whatever you recommend.

155
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:19,372
How about a Grasshopper?
I make a mean Grasshopper.

156
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,707
Okay? Good, coming up.

157
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,878
- Sheldon, what are you gonna have?
- I'll have a Diet Coke.

158
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:29,257
Okay, can you please order a cocktail?
I need to practice mixing drinks.

159
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:32,928
Fine. I'll have a virgin Cuba Libre.

160
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,098
That's rum and Coke without the rum.

161
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,767
Yes.

162
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,102
So Coke.

163
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,729
Yes.

164
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,565
And would you make it diet?

165
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:51,905
There's a can in the fridge.

166
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:56,493
A Cuba Libre traditionally comes
in a tall glass with a lime wedge.

167
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,787
Then swim to Cuba.

168
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,083
Bartenders are supposed
to have people skills.

169
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:07,963
Okay. Raj, here you go.

170
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,464
All right. Who's next?

171
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,384
I'd like to try a Slippery Nipple.

172
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:19,182
Okay, you're cut off.

173
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,185
Anybody need a refill?

174
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,145
Where did my life go, Penny?

175
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,317
One day I'm a bachelor,
and the next I'm married...

176
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:33,863
...and driving a minivan to peewee cricket
matches in suburban New Delhi.

177
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,200
Are you talking to me?

178
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,995
Is there another Penny here?

179
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,665
I had such plans. I had dreams.

180
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:47,210
I was going to be the Indira Gandhi
of particle astrophysics.

181
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,588
But with a penis, of course.

182
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,549
It's amazing.

183
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,175
Ever since I was a little boy...

184
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:57,220
...my father wanted me
to be a gynecologist like him.

185
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:01,349
How can I be a gynecologist?
I can barely look a woman in the eye.

186
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:08,189
You know what? I'm not going
to let my parents control my future.

187
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,816
It's time for a showdown.

188
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,110
Somebody give me a computer
with a Webcam.

189
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:16,364
Okay. Sweetie, I think
that's the Grasshopper talking.

190
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,033
It's about to tell my parents...

191
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,536
...that I'm not riding an elephant
down the aisle with Lalita Gupta.

192
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,622
Okay, calm down.

193
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,999
No one can make you get married.

194
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,585
Why don't you meet this girl,
see what happens?

195
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,338
Haven't you been listening?
I cannot talk to women.

196
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,758
- Raj...
- No, no, let's see how long it takes him.

197
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,385
Raj, honey...

198
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:41,014
...you say you can't talk to women
but you've been talking to me.

199
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,350
And now we'll never know.

200
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,728
You're right. I...

201
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,355
I am talking to you.

202
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,900
Hello, Penny. How are you?

203
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,610
I'm fine.

204
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,071
Okay, now, I need to
make sure I have a Lalita...

205
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,239
...before I meet the Grasshopper.

206
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:04,204
It's a sweet green miracle.

207
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,707
If you're gonna drink on this date,
just promise me you won't overdo it.

208
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,417
Overdo what?

209
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,378
Happiness?

210
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,088
Freedom?

211
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:18,760
This warm glow inside of me that promises
everything's going to be all hunky dunky?

212
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,470
Yeah, that.

213
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,890
Why don't you bring her to my restaurant
so I can keep an eye on you?

214
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,684
Okay.

215
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:29,938
What's the plan? Let's say he meets her,
he likes her, they get married.

216
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,941
What's he gonna do,
stay drunk for the rest of his life?

217
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,360
It worked for my parents.

218
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,990
<font color="#E86CE4">(PLAYING SLOW MUSIC ON PIANO)</font>

219
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:50,583
I can't believe I'm sitting here
next to little Lalita Gupta.

220
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,627
Well, you are.

221
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,921
Little Lalita.

222
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,631
That's kind of fun to say.

223
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,968
Little Lalita, little Lalita, little Lalita.

224
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,637
- You should try it.
- Oh, it's okay.

225
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,308
You have lost so much weight.

226
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:11,980
That must have been difficult for you
because you were so, so fat.

227
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:14,691
Do you remember?

228
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,318
- Yes, I do.
- Of course you do.

229
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:20,196
Who could forget being that fat?

230
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,574
Well, I've been trying.

231
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,035
- So you're a dental student?
- Hmm.

232
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:31,332
Mm! Are you aware that dentists
have an extremely high suicide rate?

233
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,670
Not as high as air traffic controllers,
but there are far more dentists...

234
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:39,507
...than air traffic controllers,
so in pure numbers, you're still winning.

235
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,593
Yay, me.

236
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,554
Do you have a drink
that'll make him less obnoxious?

237
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,682
Drinks do not work that way.

238
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,185
I'd say he's doing fine. Look at her.

239
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:54,105
The last girl my mom set me up with
had a mustache and a vestigial tail.

240
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,067
- Sorry I'm late.
- What happened?

241
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,820
Nothing. I just really didn't wanna come.

242
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,533
Virgin diet Cuba Libre, please.

243
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:09,662
- Okay.
- In a tall glass with a lime wedge.

244
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,874
Oh, I'll wedge it right in there.

245
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,211
So how's Koothrappali...?

246
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,670
Oh, my Lord.

247
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,673
- What?
- That's Princess Panchali.

248
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,717
I'm pretty sure her name's Lalita.

249
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:27,055
No, no. Princess Panchali
from The Monkey and The Princess.

250
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:31,935
Oh, yeah, I tried to watch that online
but they wanted my credit card.

251
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,437
It's a children's story.

252
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,564
Oh, no, it isn't.

253
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:42,487
When I was a little boy and got sick,
which was most of the time...

254
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,030
...my mother would read it.

255
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:47,242
It's about an Indian princess
who befriends a monkey...

256
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:50,411
...who was mocked by the other monkeys
because he was different.

257
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,748
For some reason,
I related to it quite strongly.

258
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,917
I know the reason.

259
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,045
We all know the reason.

260
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,589
Sheldon, what are you getting at?

261
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:05,593
That woman looks exactly like the pictures
of Princess Panchali in the book.

262
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,764
How often does one see a beloved
fictional character come to life?

263
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,433
Every year at Comic-Con.

264
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,185
Every day at Disneyland.

265
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,896
You can hire Snow White
to come to your house.

266
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,691
Of course, they prefer it if you have a kid.

267
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,569
Hey, guys. This is Lalita Gupta.

268
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:26,030
Lalita, this is Leonard and Sheldon
and Howard and Penny.

269
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,158
Isn’t it great? She isn't fat anymore.

270
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,077
Forgive me, Your Highness...

271
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,955
...for I am but a monkey
and it is in my nature to climb.

272
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,625
I did not mean to gaze upon you
as you comb your hair.

273
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,211
I'm sorry?

274
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,506
You are the living embodiment
of the beautiful Princess Panchali.

275
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,135
Oh, no kidding. Who is that?

276
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,888
A beloved character
from an Indian folktale.

277
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,681
Oh.

278
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,851
Us Indian
or "come to our casino" Indian?

279
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,479
- You Indian.
- Oh.

280
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,899
The resemblance is remarkable.

281
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:04,485
I can practically smell the lotus blossoms
woven into your ebony hair.

282
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,487
Well, thanks.

283
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,990
I imagine you smell very nice too.

284
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,994
I shower twice a day
and wash my hands as often as I can.

285
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,330
Really? So do I.

286
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:18,499
But you're a dentist, he's nuts.

287
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,753
Don't be insulting, Rajesh.

288
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,715
So, Sheldon, tell me more about
this princess you say I look like.

289
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:29,928
It was said that the gods
fashioned her eyes out of the stars...

290
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:34,098
...and that roses were ashamed to bloom
in the presence of her ruby lips.

291
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,017
Oh, my.

292
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,186
- Back off, Sheldon.
- What?

293
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:42,690
If you do not stop hitting on my lady,
you will feel the full extent of my wrath.

294
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:44,692
I'm not hitting on her.

295
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,402
And I am not your lady.

296
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,030
And you have no wrath.

297
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,700
You are my lady. Our parents said so.

298
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,370
We are, for all purposes,
100 percent hooked up.

299
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,163
Let's get something straight.

300
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,333
The only reason I came tonight
was to get my parents off my case.

301
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:03,252
I don't need to be getting
this old-world crap from you.

302
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,715
That's the kind of spirit with which Princess
Panchali led the monkeys to freedom.

303
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,134
- Screw Panchali.
- You can't talk to me like that.

304
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,844
But you're not Princess Panchali.

305
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:14,389
Luckily for you.
She could have you beheaded.

- Sheldon, are you hungry?
- I could eat.

Let's go.

Beats the hell out of me.

I'll tell you what happened. I just
learned how to pick up Indian chicks.

I play golf with her father.
I won't be able to look at him.

Maybe you should keep

it wasn't entirely Raj's fault.

- No, I'm Leonard.

Oh. Sorry. You all look alike to us.

How would I know?
Do you have a low sperm count?

This has nothing to do
with my sperm count.

Yes, Mommy.

- What did I do?

You left with his date.

Take it, Raj.
It's more than I've ever gotten.

- And boring. Her words.

I knew it, he moves to America
and becomes an alcoholic.

I'm not an alcoholic.

342
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,663
Then why were you drunk?

It was just this one time, Papa, I swear.

Don't embarrass him

We ate, she lectured me on the link
