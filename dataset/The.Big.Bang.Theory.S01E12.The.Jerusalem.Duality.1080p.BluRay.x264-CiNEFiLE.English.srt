1
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:09,967
Here's the problem with teleportation.

2
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,638
Lay it on me.

3
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,598
Assuming a device could be invented...

4
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:20,436
...which would identify the state of matter
of an individual in one location...

5
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:23,439
...and transmit that to a distant location
for reassembly...

6
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:25,858
...you wouldn't have
transported the individual...

7
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:31,155
...you would have destroyed him in one
location and re-created him in another.

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,366
How about that.

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,785
I would never use a transporter.

10
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:39,621
The original Sheldon
would have to be disintegrated...

11
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,541
...in order to create a new Sheldon.

12
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:47,087
Would the new Sheldon be in any way
an improvement on the old Sheldon?

13
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,299
No, he would be exactly the same.

14
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,342
That is a problem.

15
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,761
So you see it too?

16
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,847
Dr. Hofstadter, Dr. Cooper.

17
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,223
<font color="#808080">BOTH</font>:
Dr. Gablehauser.

18
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,768
Gentlemen,
I'd like you to meet Dennis Kim.

19
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:03,771
Dennis is a highly sought-after
doctoral candidate.

20
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:06,065
We're hoping to have him
do graduate work here.

21
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:09,485
- Graduate work, very impressive.
- And he's only 15 years old.

22
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:13,530
Not bad.
I myself started graduate school at 14.

23
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:17,201
Well, I lost a year while my family
was tunneling out of North Korea.

24
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,372
Advantage, Kim.

25
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,000
I thought maybe you
could show Dennis around.

26
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:28,504
Let him see why we're the best
physics research facility in the country.

27
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:29,713
I know you're not.

28
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:33,217
You don't have an Open Science Grid
computer or a free electron laser.

29
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,969
The string theory research
being done is a dead end.

30
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:39,848
Excuse me, that is my research,
and it is by no means a dead end.

31
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:43,060
Well, obviously, you don't see it yet,
but trust me, you will.

32
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,439
Dennis, we've discussed this.

33
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,983
We're in the process
of updating our equipment.

34
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:52,319
We welcome your input
on our research goals.

35
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:55,030
We agree to look the other way
if you use 20 percent...

36
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:58,575
...of the money you attract to smuggle
your grandfather out of Pyongyang.

37
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,371
We want him here, boys.

38
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,039
- Make it happen.
- Yes, sir.

39
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,041
You can count on us. We're on it.

40
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,502
What the hell do you mean, "dead end"?

41
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,880
I mean, the whole landscape
of false vacuums in string theory...

42
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,383
...could be as large
as 10 to the 500th power.

43
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,551
In addition...

44
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:17,094
Ooh, look, chocolate milk.

45
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:23,016
I sense a disturbance in the force.

46
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:26,478
<font color="#E86CE4">(IMITATING YODA)</font>
A bad feeling I have about this. Mm.

47
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,589
So how long have you been in America?

48
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,215
- A year and a half.
- No kidding.

49
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:58,594
- You speak English really well.
- So do you.

50
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:03,432
Except for your tendency
to end sentences with prepositions.

51
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,976
What are you talking about?

52
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,021
That.

53
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:10,689
He's not wrong.

54
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,984
All right, and this is my office.

55
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,570
- Is this part of the tour?
- Nope. Goodbye.

56
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,698
Sheldon,
we've hardly shown him anything.

57
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,493
All right, this is my desk.
These are my books.

58
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:26,455
This is my door.
Please close it behind you, goodbye.

59
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,959
You're doing work
in quantum loop corrections.

60
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:35,631
- Keen observation, goodbye.
- You see where you went wrong, don't you?

61
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:37,966
- Leonard.
- Ha.

62
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,969
- Yeah?
- Get him out.

63
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,848
Come, I'll show you the rec center.
They've got Nautilus equipment.

64
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,808
Do I look like I lift weights?

65
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,395
Not heavy ones.

66
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:54,441
It's startling you haven't considered
a Lorentz invariant or field theory approach.

67
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,985
You think I haven't considered it?

68
00:03:57,153 --> 00:04:00,405
- You really think I haven't considered it?
- Have you considered it?

69
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:04,201
- Get him out, Leonard.
- Come on, Dennis.

70
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:07,162
I'll show you the radiation lab.

71
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,623
Wow. You won the Stevenson Award?

72
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:13,877
Yes. In fact,
I am the youngest person ever to win it.

73
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,380
Really? How old?

74
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:17,881
Fourteen and a half.

75
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,175
Mm. You were the youngest
ever to win it.

76
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,473
It's like looking
into an obnoxious mirror, isn't it?

77
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,439
Mm. This is really delicious, isn't it?

78
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,821
Still can't talk to me
unless you're drunk, huh?

79
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:45,951
Oh, sweetie, you are so damaged.

80
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,579
Hey, I'm damaged too.

81
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,124
How about a hug for Howie?

82
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,502
Sure. Raj, hug Howard.

83
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,463
<font color="#E86CE4">(SHELDON SIGHS)</font>

84
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,216
Something you'd like to share?

85
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,636
A tale of woe perhaps?

86
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,471
Fifteen years old.

87
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,475
Dennis Kim is 15 years old
and he's already correcting my work.

88
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:14,521
Today, I went from being
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to...

89
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,106
You know, that other guy.

90
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,399
Antonio Salieri?

91
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,902
Oh, God,
now even you're smarter than me.

92
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:26,491
You know, you don't have so many friends
that you can afford to start insulting them.

93
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,494
Just eat, Sheldon. You'll feel better.

94
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,912
Why waste food?

95
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,457
When a cow goes dry,
they don't keep feeding it...

96
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:36,960
...they just take her out
and shoot her between the eyes.

97
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:41,173
I'm confused.
Did Sheldon stop giving milk?

98
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,633
You can't let this kid get to you.

99
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:47,262
You knew that someday, someone would
come along who's younger and smarter.

100
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,098
Yes, but I assumed
I would've been dead hundreds of years.

101
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:53,810
And that there'd be an asterisk by his name
because he'd be a cyborg.

102
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:58,482
So you got a little competition.
I really don't see what the big deal is.

103
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:02,778
Of course you don't.
You've never excelled at anything.

104
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,491
I don't understand, exactly how did
he get any friends in the first place?

105
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,619
We liked Leonard.

106
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,122
What are you gonna do, just give up?

107
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:19,378
Yes, it's what a rational person does
when his entire life's work is invalidated...

108
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,339
...by a postpubescent Asian wunderkind.

109
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:27,469
He ceases his fruitless efforts,
he donates his body to scientific research...

110
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,180
...and he waits to die.

111
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:36,228
I'm confused again. Is he waiting, or do
we get to shoot him between the eyes?

112
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,649
- Hey.
- Hey.

113
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,192
I've decided you're right.

114
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,528
- My career is not over.
- Great.

115
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:47,739
But since Dennis Kim
has rendered my research pointless...

116
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,367
...I just have to find
something else to focus on.

117
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,701
Great.

118
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,496
So I've decided
I'm going to collaborate with you.

119
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,209
Great.

120
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,211
So, what exactly is it you do?

121
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:06,299
I know you chatter on about it all the time,
but I've never really paid attention.

122
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:10,220
Right now, I'm designing an experiment
to study the soft component...

123
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,140
...of cosmic radiation at sea level,
but I don't need help.

124
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,350
Oh, sure you do.

125
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,478
Now see, what's this here in the schematic,
a laser array?

126
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,355
- Yes.
- Now, hmm...

127
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,736
What happens if you use argon lasers
instead of helium-neon?

128
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,239
- It would blow up.
- Are you sure?

129
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,242
- Pretty sure.
- "Pretty sure" is not very scientific.

130
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:36,204
Is this how you normally work?
Just hunches and guesses and stuff?

131
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,206
Okay.

132
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:41,418
I understand that you're going
through a bit of a career crisis.

133
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:45,422
You're searching for some other area
where you can feel valuable and productive.

134
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,133
But I need to tell you something,
and listen carefully.

135
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:51,595
- All right.
- Go away.

136
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:58,727
If you're concerned about sharing credit
with me, your name can go first... I'm going.

137
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,941
It's a small brown paper bag, Ma.

138
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:08,069
I'm looking at it right now.

139
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:12,908
Why would I make that up?
There's no Ding Dong in it.

140
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:18,955
How are two Ding Dongs tomorrow
gonna help me today?

141
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,502
So this is Engineering, huh?

142
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,795
I'll talk to you later.

143
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,715
Engineering,
where the noble semiskilled laborers...

144
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,760
...execute the vision
of those who think and dream.

145
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,013
Hello, Oompa Loompas of science.

146
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,392
Sheldon, what are you doing here?

147
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,811
I just came by to say hello.

148
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:44,648
For three years,
you've never come by to say hello.

149
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:47,317
Well, up until now,
I've had better things to do.

150
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,403
So, what are we making today?

151
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:54,783
A small payload support structure for
a European science experimental package...

152
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:58,495
- ...that's going up on the next space shuttle.
- Really? How does it work?

153
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,789
It will be attached to the payload bay...

154
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:04,543
...and the sensor apparatus will rest on it.

155
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,169
Aha.

156
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,130
So it's a shelf.

157
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,301
No, you don't understand.

158
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:16,763
During acceleration, it needs
to stay perfectly level and provide...

159
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,348
Yeah, okay, it's a shelf.

160
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,642
I notice you're using titanium.

161
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,144
Did you give any consideration
to carbon nanotubes?

162
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:26,273
They're lighter, cheaper
and have twice the tensile strength.

163
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:32,028
Sheldon, there's a diploma in my office
that says I have a master's in engineering.

164
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:36,032
And you also have a note from your mother
that says, "I love you, Bubula."

165
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:41,705
But neither of those is a cogent argument
for titanium over nanotubes.

166
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,707
- Sheldon.
- Yes?

167
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,042
Go away.

168
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,211
Did Leonard tell you to say that?

169
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,547
No, I thought of it all by myself.

170
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:55,594
Huh? Can't be a coincidence.

171
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:59,222
There must be some causal link
I'm missing.

172
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:04,603
Go away.

- If he were, I wouldn't be.

175
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,040
You know what he did?
He watched me work...

176
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:29,711
...and then started to design a simple piece
of software that could replace me.

177
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,130
Is that even possible?

178
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,174
As it turns out, yes.

179
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,470
- Something's gotta be done about him.
- Like what?

180
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,890
He'll never cope with the fact
that some 15-year-old is smarter...

181
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,767
...and more accomplished than he is.

182
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:48,563
What if something were to happen to him
so he was no longer a threat to Sheldon?

183
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,567
Then our problem would be solved.

I'm not saying no.

We don't have to go that far.
There are other means.

187
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:05,455
We can't send him back to North Korea.

188
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:06,873
He knows how to get out.

189
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,712
The only thing we need to do
is make this Kim kid lose his focus.

190
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,757
It won't happen. He is not interested
in anything but physics.

191
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,634
- What about biology?
- What?

192
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,804
You know, biology.

a world-class mind.

- Howard, he's 15.
- Yeah, so?

195
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,061
When I was 15, I met Denise Palmeri...

196
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:32,315
...and my grade point average
fell from a 5.0 to a 1.8.

197
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,775
She was sleeping with you?

198
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:38,863
No, I just wasted a lot of time thinking
about what it would be like if she did.

Oh, good, you're all here.

whatever you're working on and join me...

Hmm.

- Howard, that's racist.

Any 15-year-old girl will do the trick.

Okay, it's definitely me.

We cannot leave this to chance.
Let's pick a girl...

...and figure out

00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:43,144
Dennis? Dennis.

307
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,480
What?

308
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,941
Would you like to tell us
about your upcoming research?

309
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:52,320
Oh, no, thanks.
I'm going to the mall with Emma.

310
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,952
The kid got a girl.

311
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,080
Unbelievable.

312
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,750
Did anyone see how he did it?

313
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,919
Don't worry, I've got this.

314
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:12,048
Ladies and gentlemen,
honored daughters...

315
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:15,384
...while Mr. Kim,
by virtue of his youth and naiveté...

316
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:18,846
...has fallen prey to the inexplicable need
for human contact...

317
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:22,850
...let me step in and assure you
that my research will go on uninterrupted.

318
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:28,147
And that social relationships
will continue to baffle and repulse me.

319
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,899
Thank you.

320
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:31,901

321
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,904
- He's back.
- Yeah, mission accomplished.

322
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:38,324
Forget the mission. How did that
little yutz get a girl on his own?

323
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,244
I guess times have changed
since we were young.

324
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,538
Smart is the new sexy.

325
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:47,291
Then why do we go home alone
every night? We're still smart.

326
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,377
Maybe we're too smart.

327
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,337
So smart, it's off-putting.

328
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,174
Yeah, let's go with that.

329
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,138
Unbelievable.

330
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,890
Components I built
are on the space station...

331
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,810
...and I get a ticket
for launching a rocket in the park.

332
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,897
I don't know if the ticket was so much for
the launch as for telling the policewoman:

333
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:13,359
"You have to frisk me.
I have another rocket in my pants."

334
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,528
Hey, look at that.

335
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,323
It's Dennis Kim.

336
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,909
Wow, I almost didn't recognize him.

337
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,078
I kind of feel bad
about what we did to him.

338
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,419
Yeah, we really ruined his life.

339
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,256
Screw him, he was weak.
