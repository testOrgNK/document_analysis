1
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:11,051
Okay, if no one else will say it, I will.

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,721
We really suck at paintball.

3
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,807
<font color="#808080">HOWARD</font>:
That was absolutely humiliating.

4
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,977
<font color="#808080">LEONARD</font>: Oh, come on. Some battles
you win, some battles you lose.

5
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:25,524
<font color="#808080">HOWARD</font>: Yes, but you don't have to lose
to Kyle Bernstein's bar mitzvah party.

6
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:31,405
I think we have to acknowledge, those were
some fairly savage preadolescent Jews.

7
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,868
No, we were annihilated
by our own incompetence...

8
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,121
...and the inability of some people
to follow the chain of command.

9
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,622
Sheldon, let it go.

10
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:45,044
No, I wanna talk about the fact
that Wolowitz shot me in the back.

11
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:49,840
I shot you for a good reason.
You were leading us into disaster.

12
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:52,426
I was giving clear, concise orders.

13
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,011
You hid behind a tree yelling:

14
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:57,014
"Get the kid in the yarmulke!
Get the kid in the yarmulke!"

15
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,640
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Oh, hey, Penny.

16
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:00,517
- Hello.
- Morning, ma'am.

17
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,562
So how was paintball?
Did you have fun?

18
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,649
Sure, if you consider being fragged
by your own troops fun.

19
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,653
You clear a space on your calendar.
There will be an inquiry.

20
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,405
Okay. Um...

21
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,408
I'm having a party on Saturday,
so if you're around, come by.

22
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:17,743
- A party?
- Yeah.

23
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,829
A boy-girl party?

24
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,249
There will be boys
and there will be girls...

25
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,001
...and it is a party, so...

26
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:29,129
Just a bunch of my friends,
have some beer, do a little dancing.

27
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:30,422
- Dancing?
- Yeah.

28
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,674
- I don't know, Penny...
- Thing is, we're not...

29
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:34,551
- We're really more of a...
- No.

30
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,138
But thanks.
Thanks for thinking of us.

31
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,932
Are you sure? It's Halloween.

32
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,475
A Halloween party?

33
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,060
As in costumes?

34
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,603
Well, yeah.

35
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,863
Is there a theme?

36
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,573
Um, yeah, Halloween.

37
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,244
Yes, but are the costumes random
or genre-specific?

38
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:03,539
As usual, I'm not following.

39
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:06,875
He's asking if we can come as anyone
from science fiction...

40
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,127
- ...fantasy...
- Sure.

41
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,586
- Comic books?
- Fine.

42
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,213
- Anime?
- Of course.

43
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,799
TV, film, D&D, manga.
Greek, Roman, Norse gods...

44
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,050
Anything you want.

45
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,095
Okay? Any costume you want.

46
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,806
Bye.

47
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,144
Gentlemen, to the sewing machines.

I'll get it.

50
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,892
Psshoo.

51
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,730
Oh, no.

52
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,149
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>:
Oh, no.

53
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:16,820
Make way for the fastest man alive.

54
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,322
Oh, no.

55
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:21,283
See, this is why I wanted
to have a costume meeting.

56
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,785
We all have other costumes.
We can change.

57
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,872
Or we could walk right
behind each other all night.

58
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,750
It'll look like one person
going really fast.

59
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,258
No, no, no.

60
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:42,429
It's a boy-girl party,
this Flash runs solo.

61
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,599
Okay, how about this?
Nobody gets to be the Flash.

62
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:46,808
We all change. Agreed?

63
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,187
<font color="#808080">ALL</font>:
Agreed.

64
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,731
I call Frodo!

65
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,149
<font color="#808080">ALL</font>:
Damn.

66
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,616
Hey.

67
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:08,538
Sorry I'm late, but my hammer got stuck
in the door on the bus.

68
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,832
- You went with Thor?
- What?

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,877
Just because I'm Indian,
I can't be a Norse god?

70
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:17,005
No, no, no, Raj has to be an Indian god.

71
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,465
That's racism.

72
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:22,219
I mean, look at Wolowitz. He's not English,
but he's dressed like Peter Pan.

73
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:27,557
Sheldon is neither sound nor light,
but he's obviously the Doppler effect.

74
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,732
- I'm not Peter Pan, I'm Robin Hood.
- Really?

75
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:39,486
Because I saw Peter Pan
and you're dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby.

76
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,866
She was a little bigger than you,
but it's basically the same look, man.

77
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,870
Sheldon, there's something
I wanna talk to you about before we go.

78
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:53,083
I don't care if anybody gets it,
I'm going as the Doppler effect.

79
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:58,005
- No, it's not that...
- If I have to, I can demonstrate: Vroom.

80
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:03,218
Terrific. Um...

81
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,263
This party is my first chance for Penny...

82
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,516
...to see me in the context
of her social group...

83
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,352
...and I need you not
to embarrass me tonight.

84
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,522
What exactly do you mean
by embarrass you?

85
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:21,695
For example, tonight, no one needs to know
that my middle name is Leakey.

86
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,864
But there's nothing embarrassing
about that.

87
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:27,242
Your father worked with Louis Leakey,
a great anthropologist.

88
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,953
It had nothing to do
with your bed-wetting.

89
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,416
All I'm saying is that this party
is the perfect opportunity...

90
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,627
...for Penny to see me
as a member of her peer group...

91
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:41,048
...a potential close friend
and perhaps more.

92
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,260
I don't wanna look like a dork.

93
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,439
Just a heads up, fellas,
if anyone gets lucky...

94
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,150
...I've got a dozen condoms in my quiver.

95
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,445
Oh, hey, guys.

96
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,155
Hey, sorry we're late.

97
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,157
Late? It's 7:05.

98
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,368
And you said the party starts at 7.

99
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:15,248
Yeah, I mean, when you start a party at 7,
no one shows up at, you know, 7.

100
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,417
It's 7:05.

101
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:19,961
Yes, yes, it is.

102
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,464
Okay, well, um, come on in.

103
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,100
What, are all the girls in the bathroom?

104
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,811
Probably, but in their own homes.

105
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,981
So, what time
does the costume parade start?

106
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,983
The parade?

107
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:44,986
Yeah, so the judges can give out
the prizes for best costume.

108
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,905
Most frightening, most authentic...

109
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:50,742
...most accurate visualization
of a scientific principle.

110
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,995
Oh, Sheldon, I'm sorry...

111
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:58,333
...but there aren't gonna be any parades
or judges or prizes.

112
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,045
This party is just going to suck.

113
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:05,006
No, come on, it's gonna be fun.
And you all look great.

114
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:08,051
I mean, look at you, Thor,
and, oh, Peter Pan.

115
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,303
That's so cute.

116
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:13,598
- Actually, Penny, he's Robin...
- I'm Peter Pan.

117
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,853
And I've got a handful of pixie dust
with your name on it.

118
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,564
No, you don't.

119
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,987
- Hey, what's Sheldon supposed to be?
- Oh, he's the Doppler effect.

120
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,865
Yes, it's the apparent change
in the frequency of a wave...

121
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:33,743
...caused by relative motion between
the source of the wave and the observer.

122
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:39,291
Oh, sure, I see it now.
The Doppler effect.

123
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:43,003
All right, I gotta shower. You guys,
um, make yourselves comfortable.

124
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,046
Okay.

125
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,842
See? People get it.

Mm. By Odin's beard,
this is good Chex Mix.

129
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,319
No, thanks. Peanuts.

130
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,530
I can't afford to swell up in these tights.

131
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:11,907
I'm confused.

132
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:14,951
If there's no costume parade,
what are we doing here?

133
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,705
We're socializing, meeting new people.

134
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,208
Telepathically?

135
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,711
- Oh, hey. When did you get here?
<font color="#808080">WOMAN</font>: Hi.

136
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:28,256
Penny is wearing the worst
Catwoman costume I've ever seen.

137
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,258
And that includes Halle Berry's.

138
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:33,261
She's not Catwoman.
She's just a generic cat.

139
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,305
And that's the kind
of sloppy costuming...

140
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:38,725
...which results
from a lack of rules and competition.

141
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:43,271
Hey, guys, check out the sexy nurse.

142
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:48,610
I believe it's time for me
to turn my head and cough.

143
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,989
- What is your move?
- I'm going to use the mirror technique.

144
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,992
She brushes her hair back, I brush mine.
She shrugs, I shrug.

145
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,663
Subconsciously, she's thinking,
"We're in sync. We belong together."

146
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,998
Where do you get this stuff?

147
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:05,001
You know, psychology journals,
Internet research.

148
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:09,130
And there's this great show on VH1
about how to pick up girls.

149
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,635
Oh, if only I had his confidence.

150
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,096
I have such difficulty
speaking to women...

151
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:20,475
...or around women,
or at times even effeminate men.

152
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,770
If that's a working stethoscope...

153
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,481
...maybe you'd like to hear
my heart skip a beat.

154
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,608
No, thanks.

155
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:31,945
No, seriously, you can.
I have transient idiopathic arrhythmia.

158
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,785
Take my money

159
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,663
I wanna get to know Penny's friends.
I just...

160
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,332
I don't know
how to talk to these people.

161
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,461
- Well, I actually might be able to help.
- How so?

162
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,131
Like Jane Goodall observing the apes...

163
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:55,010
...I initially saw their interactions
as confusing and unstructured.

164
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,219
But patterns emerge.

165
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,806
They have their own language,
if you will.

166
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,142
Go on.

167
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,645
Well, it seems that the newcomer
approaches the existing group...

168
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:08,356
...with the greeting,
"How wasted am I?"

169
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:12,319
Which is met
with an approving chorus of "Dude."

170
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,195
Then what happens?

171
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,031
That's as far as I've gotten.

172
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:18,825
This is ridiculous.

173
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,994
- I'm jumping in.
- Good luck.

174
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,537
No, you're coming with me.

175
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,706
Oh, I hardly think so.

176
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:25,915
Come on.

177
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:30,712
- Aren't you afraid I'll embarrass you?
- Yes, but I need a wingman.

178
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,673
All right, but if we're going
to use flight metaphors...

179
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:38,511
...I'm much more suited to being the guy
from the FAA analyzing wreckage.

180
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,931
Oh, hi.

181

- Hello.

182
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,518
So, what are you supposed to be?

183
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,228
Me?

184
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,481
I'll give you a hint.

185
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,232
Vroom.

186
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,610

187
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,904
Close.

188
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,864
Vroom.

189
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,116
A brain-damaged choo-choo train?

190

How wasted am I?

191
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,207
Dancing all by myself

192

I still don't get it.

I'm the Doppler effect.

197
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,222
Okay, if that is some sort
of learning disability...

198
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,557
...I think it's very insensitive.

199
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,395
Why don't you just tell people
you're a zebra?

200
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,315
Why don't you just tell people
you're one of the seven dwarves?

201
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,608
Because I'm Frodo.

202
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,695
Yes, well, I'm the Doppler effect.

203
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,656
- Oh, no.
- What?

204
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,825
That's Penny's ex-boyfriend.

205
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,702
What do you suppose he's doing here?

206
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:47,080
Besides disrupting the local gravity field.

207
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,875
If he were any bigger,
he'd have moons orbiting him.

208
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,294
- Oh, snap.
- Ha-ha.

209
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,047
So I guess we'll be leaving now.

210
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,966
Why should we leave?

211
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,761
For all we know, he crashed the party
and Penny doesn't even want him here.

212
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,849
You have a backup hypothesis?

213
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,934
Maybe they just wanna be friends.

214
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:12,439
Or maybe she wants to be friends
and he wants something more.

215
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,357
Then he and I are on equal ground.

216
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,819
Yes, but you're much closer to it
than he is.

217
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:23,283
Look, if this was 15,000 years ago,
by virtue of his size and strength...

218
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,161
...Kurt would be entitled
to his choice of female partners.

219
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:29,330
And male partners, animal partners,
large primordial eggplants...

220
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:32,000
...pretty much
whatever tickled his fancy.

221
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,253
Yes, but our society
has undergone a paradigm shift.

222

In the information age, Sheldon,
you and I are the alpha males.

223
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,343
- And we shouldn't have to back down.
- True.

224
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,680
Why don't you text him that
and see if he backs down?

225
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,016
No.

226
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:52,103
I'm going to assert
my dominance face to face.

227
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,354
Face to face?

228
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:57,192
Are you gonna wait for him to sit down
or you gonna stand on the coffee table?

229
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,445
Hello, Penny. Hello, Kurt.

230
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,405
Oh, hey, guys.
You having a good time?

231
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,199
Given the reaction to my costume...

232
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:08,203
...this party is a scathing indictment
of the American education system.

233
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,288
What? You're a zebra, right?

234

Yet another child left behind.

235
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,711
And what are you supposed to be,
an elf?

236
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,087
No, I'm a hobbit.

237
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,547
What's the difference?

238
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,717
A hobbit is a mortal, halfling inhabitant
of Middle-earth...

239
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:26,012
...whereas an elf
is an immortal, tall warrior.

240
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,057
So why the hell
would you wanna be a hobbit?

241
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:33,520
Because he's neither tall nor immortal,
and none of us could be the Flash.

242
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:38,775
Well, whatever. Why don't you go hop off
on a quest? I'm talking to Penny here.

243
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,902
I think we're all talking to Penny here.

244
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,445
I'm not. No offense.

245
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,198
Okay, maybe you didn't hear me.

246
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,408
- Go away.
- All right, Kurt, be nice.

247
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:50,161
Oh, I am being nice.

248
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,121
Right, little buddy?

249
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,415
- Kurt.
- Okay.

250
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,419
I understand your impulse
to try to physically intimidate me.

251
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:01,047
You can't compete with me
on an intellectual level...

252
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,008
...and so you're driven
to animalistic puffery.

253
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,427
You calling me a puffy animal?

254
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:07,720
Oh, of course not.

255
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,223
No, he's not. You're not, right, Leonard?

256
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,351
No, I said animalistic.

257
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,019
Of course, we're all animals...

258
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,565
...but some of us have climbed
a little higher on the evolutionary tree.

259
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,900
If he understands that, you're in trouble.

260
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,944
So what? I'm unevolved?

261
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,362
You're in trouble.

262
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:28,616
You know, you use a lot of big words
for such a little dwarf.

263
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:29,826
Okay, Kurt, please.

264
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,286
Look, Penny, it's okay.

265
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,704
I can handle this.

266
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:36,624
I am not a dwarf, I'm a hobbit.

267
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:37,834
A hobbit.

out of your pointy little head?

I am so sorry about what happened.

310
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,356
It's not your fault.

311
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,942
Yes, it is.
That's why I broke up with him.

312
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,695
He always does stuff like that.

313
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,948
So why was he at your party?

314
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:18,619
Well, I ran into him last week...

315
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:22,248
...and he was just all apologetic
about how he's changed.

316
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,501
He was just going on and on,
and I believed him.

317
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:28,838
And I'm an idiot,
because I always believe guys like that.

318
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,050
And I can't go back to my party
because he's there.

319
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:36,220
And I know you don't wanna hear this. I'm
upset and really drunk and I just wanna...

There, there.

322
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,320
God, what is wrong with me?

323
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,905
Nothing, you're perfect.

324
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,448
Ecch. I'm not perfect.

325
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,908
Yes, you are.

326
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,913
You really think so, don't you?

327
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,346
- Penny?
- Yeah?

328
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:22,141
How much have you had
to drink tonight?

329
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,271
Just... a lot.

330
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:32,068
Are you sure that your being drunk
and your being angry with Kurt...

331
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,904
...doesn't have something to do
with what's going on here?

332
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,199
It might.

Boy, you're really smart.

335
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,540
Yeah, I'm a freaking genius.

336
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,921
Leonard, you are so great.

337
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,090
Why can't all guys be like you?

338
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:59,470
Because if all guys were like me,
the human race couldn't survive.

339
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,684
I should probably go.

340
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,102
Probably.

341
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,321
Thank you.

342
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:30,001
That's right, you saw what you saw.

343
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,672
That's how we roll in the Shire.

Hey, have you seen Koothrappali?

347
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,399
He's not here.

348
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,319
Maybe the Avengers summoned him.

349
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,114
He's not the Marvel Comics Thor,
he's the original Norse god.

350
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,450
Thank you for the clarification.

351
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:05,620
- I'm supposed to give him a ride home.
- I'm sure he'll be fine.

352
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,788
He has his hammer.

353
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,044
Wow.

354
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:19,425
I have to say, you are an amazing man.

355
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,970
You're gentle and passionate.

356
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:27,975
And, my God,
you are such a good listener.
