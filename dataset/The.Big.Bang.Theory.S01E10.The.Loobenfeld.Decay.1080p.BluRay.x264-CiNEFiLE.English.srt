No, see, the liquid-metal terminators
were created in the future by Skynet...

2
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:09,216
...and Skynet was developed
by Miles Dyson...

3
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:13,345
...but that future no longer exists
due to Dyson's death in Terminator 2.

4
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:16,098
Okay, then riddle me this.

5
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,933
Assuming all the good terminators...

6
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,728
...were originally evil terminators
created by Skynet...

7
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:23,939
...then reprogrammed by the future
John Connor, why would Skynet...

8
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,025
...an artificial computer intelligence...

9
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:30,404
...bother to create
a petite, hot, 17-year-old killer robot?

10
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,366
Skynet is kinky? I don't know.

11
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:38,912
Artificial intelligences
do not have teen fetishes.

12

- Eh! Too late, I win.

- What?

We just had to mail some letters.

And throw away some chicken.

You'll never guess what just happened.

- I don't guess.

As a scientist, I reach conclusions

Although it occurs to me, you may
have been employing a rhetorical device...

29
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,199
...rendering my response moot.

I have a conclusion

No, you don't.

No, he doesn't.

- Yes, I did.

50
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,426
And you did it so casually.

51

No rapid breathing,
no increase in perspiration.

52

- So lack of a physiological response...

53

Sheldon, are you worried
about your safety?

55

No. I imagine if you were going to kill me,

62
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,672
I highly doubt that.

Go away.

00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,737
I clearly woke you up
in the middle of a REM cycle.

70
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:44,324
- You're in no state of mind to talk.
- Sheldon, what is it?

71
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,996
I'm uncomfortable
having been included in your lie to Penny.

72
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,791
- What was I supposed to say?
- You could have told her the truth.

73
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,584
That would have hurt her feelings.

74
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,671
Is that a relevant factor?

75
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,047
Yes.

76
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,258
Then I suppose
you could have agreed to go.

77
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,927
And what would I have said afterwards?

78
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,179
I would suggest something
to the effect of:

79
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:09,725
"Singing is neither an appropriate vocation
nor avocation for you...

80
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:13,103
...and if you disagree, I recommend
a CAT scan to look for a tumor...

81
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,815
...pressing on the cognitive
processing centers of your brain."

82
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,234
I couldn't say that.

83
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:23,697
I would have to say, "You were terrific
and I can't wait to hear you sing again."

84
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,033
Why?

85
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,993
It's the social protocol.

86
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,202
It's what you do...

87
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,748
...when you have a friend who's proud
of something they really suck at.

88

I was not aware of that.

...we're going to participate
in my cousin Leopold's drug intervention.

Your cousin Leopold.

140

Whom most people call Leo,
but he also answers to Lee.

141

Remember that, it's important.

00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,488
- What's important?
- Details, Leonard.

143
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:13,825
The success or failure
of our deceitful enterprise turns on details.

144

- Do you have a cousin Leopold?
- No, I made him up.

I think you'd call him Lee.

146
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:25,545
I don't get it. I already told her a lie,
why replace it with a different lie?

147
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,507
Well, first of all,
your lie was laughably transparent...

148

...where mine is exquisitely convoluted.

149
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:36,806
While you were sleeping,
I was weaving an un-unravelable web.

- Yes.

If she Googles Leopold Houston,
she'll find a Facebook page...

00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:45,232
...an online blog
depicting his descent into drug use...

153
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:49,110
...and a desperate
yet hopeful listing on eHarmony.com.

154
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:53,782
Okay, why would I go
to a drug intervention for your cousin?

Ah! Because it's in Long Beach

00:08:58,579 --> 00:08:59,788
We're going to Long Beach?

157
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,791
Of course not, there's no cousin Leo,
there's no intervention.

158
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,585
- Focus, Leonard.
- Oh, come on.

159
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:09,756
We just leave the house on Friday night
and return in the wee hours...

160
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:13,677
...emotionally wrung out from the work
of convincing Leo to go back into rehab.

161
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,345
So he goes back into rehab?

162
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:20,767
Yes, but he can relapse if Penny
ever invites us to hear her sing again.

163
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,812
You still told her I lied.

164
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,272
Yeah, for a noble purpose.

165
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:29,192
To spare me the social embarrassment
of having a drug-addled first cousin.

166
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,112
- Which I'm assuming is embarrassing, yes?
- I don't know.

167
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:37,450
- How am I supposed to remember all this?
- That's the best part, you don't have to.

168
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:41,621
I told Penny that you would be embarrassed
if you knew she found out you had lied...

169
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:45,667
...so she's agreed to operate
as if the original lie is still in force.

170
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:53,300
So she's expecting me to lie
about going to a symposium in Pasadena...

171
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:58,471
...when in actuality, we're pretending to go
to a drug intervention in Long Beach.

172
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,473
Un-unravelable.

173
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:08,315
Oh, hey, Penny. Wow, look at you,
all ready for your showcase.

174
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:09,983
- You look great.
<font color="#808080">PENNY</font>: Thanks.

175
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:14,321
I just wanted to come by and wish you
guys luck with your symposium.

176
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,364
<font color="#808080">LEONARD</font>:
Oh.

177
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,992
- Well, thank you.
- You know, I gotta tell you.

178
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,370
A lot of friends would let their friend
go alone, but that's not you.

179
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:26,249
You are the kind of guy
who stands by a friend when...

180
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,336
When he has a symposium to go to.

181
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,716
I don't know what to say.

182
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:38,803
- It's okay, Leonard.
- Oh, okay, all right, good.

183
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,139
- Oh, boy, group hug.
- Uh-uh.

184
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:45,268
- Uh-uh?
- Okay. So, what's up?

185
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:49,564
Well, Penny is on her way to perform in
a one-night showcase production of Rent...

186
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:53,026
...which we are unable to attend,
because we're going to a symposium...

187
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:57,572
...on molecular positronium
given by Dr. Emil Farmanfarmian.

188
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,243
Wait a minute, Farmanfarmian is speaking
and you're bogarting the symposium?

189
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:05,914
- Howard, I'm sorry, we would've...
- No, no, you're quark-blocking us.

190
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,418
I don't know what to say.

191
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,961
Wow.

192
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,089
- Howard...
- It's your Millennium Falcon...

193
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:17,092
...you and Chewbacca do
whatever you wanna do.

194
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:21,930
Me and Princess Leia here will find
some other way to spend the evening.

195
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,765
Howard, wait.

196
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,976
Sheldon, I think we should tell them.

197
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,479
Okay, sure.

198
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,231
I don't see a problem with that.

199
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,567
There's no symposium.

200
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,820
Leonard lied to me.
Isn't that right, Leonard?

201
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,488
Well...

202
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:42,659
- I don't know what to say.
- It's okay, I do.

203
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,453
Look, Leonard is helping Sheldon
through a family crisis.

204
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:50,291
He made up the whole story about
the symposium with Dr. Farmanfarmian...

205
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:51,501
- Good for you.
- Ha! Yeah.

206
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:57,090
He didn't want Sheldon to be embarrassed.
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

207
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,175
Every family in America has a relative...

208
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:02,470
...holed up in a garage somewhere
huffing paint thinner.

209
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,099
No, I'm lost too.
I think she skipped a step.

210
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:11,312
Now, look, Sheldon's cousin Leo escaped
rehab and he's in a Motel 8 in Long Beach.

211
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,732
The whole family's going out
for an intervention.

212
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,609
Leonard is driving Sheldon down
to help him through this...

213
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:20,613
- ...because he's such a good man.
- Oh, another hug? Thank you.

214
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,576
- All right, you guys. Good luck.
- Thanks, Penny.

215
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,494
- Break a leg.
- Yeah, break a leg.

216
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,456
So road trip to Long Beach.

217
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:32,000
- We're not going to Long Beach.
- Why not?

218
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,211
Because Sheldon doesn't have
a drug-addicted cousin Leopold.

219
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,172
Oh, too bad.

220
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,175
I've always wanted to go to Long Beach.

221
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:43,136
It's a very nice community.
The Queen Mary is docked there.

222
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,681
Once the largest liner in the world,
it's now a hotel and restaurant...

223
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,851
...where they host a surprisingly gripping
murder-mystery dinner.

224
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,811
- Sounds fun.
- I'm game.

225
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,189
- Shotgun.
- No, no, no.

226
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:58,318
Leonard gets nauseous unless
he sits in front, and even then it's iffy.

227
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:03,531
Wait, are we really going to Long Beach?

228
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,205
<font color="#E86CE4">(KNOCKING ON DOOR)</font>

229
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:13,249
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>:
Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?

230
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,084
Let it go, Sheldon.

231
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:18,546
The murderer was the first mate
whether it makes sense to you or not.

232
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,716
No, that's the least of our worries.

233
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,718
I've been doing research on addiction...

234
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,054
...both the biochemical
and behavioral aspects...

235
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:29,432
...and I think there's a problem
with the current version of our lie.

236
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,560
What are you talking about?
It's fine, she bought it, it's over.

237
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,691
Sadly, it's not.

238
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,735
Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle.

239
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,446
But beyond that,
I have realized the Leo I described...

240
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:47,367
- ...would not have agreed to go to rehab.
- Why not?

241
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,952
Because Leo's a middle child.

242
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:53,039
There's no Leo. How can you say that?

243
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,753
You didn't read the bio, did you?

244
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:02,006
He's not just a middle child,
he is the quintessential middle child.

245
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,884
From a broken home, to boot.
Psychologically speaking...

246
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:08,471
...the attention he gets by rebelling,
even to the point of destruction...

247
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,599
...is more emotionally valuable
than help he would get at rehab.

248
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,643
- I've got a solution.
- Great. What is it?

249
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,104
Get out.

250
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,439
Fine.

251
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,989
I've hesitated to point this out...

252
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,616
...but I must remind you
we are in our predicament...

253
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:31,077
...because of your initial
and inadequate deceit.

254
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,288
I'm just trying to clean up
after your mess.

255

<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>:
We'll talk in the morning.

256
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,683
Morning.

257
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,643
Who are you?

258
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,021
I am Sheldon's cousin Leo.

259
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,607
Oh, God.

260
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,653
Sheldon does not have a cousin Leo.

261
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,530
Au contraire.

262
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:08,990
I'm 26 years old...

263
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:14,495
...I'm originally from "Denton, Texas,"
but I was a Navy brat.

264
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:17,665
I was brought up on a variety
of military bases around the world.

265
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:21,252
As a result, I've often felt like an outsider,
never really fitting in...

266
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,880
...probably the reason
for my substance-abuse problem.

267
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:27,008
Excuse me, we just went over this.

268
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:31,638
As the middle child, your addiction
is rooted in your unmet need for attention.

269
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:34,557
Oh, Sheldon, are we really gonna go
with pop psychology?

270
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,560
For your information,
this is all based on solid research.

271
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,313
Just stick with the character profile
I wrote for you.

272
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,065
- Sheldon?
- I'm sorry.

273
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,816
Leonard, this is Toby Loobenfeld.

274
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,694
He's a research assistant
in the particle-physics lab...

275
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:50,031
...but he also minored in theater at MIT.

276
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,033
It was more of a double major, actually.

277
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,451
Theater and Physics.

278
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,537
You can guess which one
my bourgeois parents pushed me towards.

279
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:57,872
Yeah, I got it.

280
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,999
Sheldon, why?

281
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,710
You see, while Leo would not
have gone into rehab...

282
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:06,881
...it is completely plausible that we would
have talked him into leaving the motel...

283
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,217
- ...and coming home with us.
- Oh...

284
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,552
Sheldon, how about this
as my motivation?

285
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,887
When I was 14 years old...

286
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:17,100
...I was abused in the Philippines
by a clubfooted Navy chaplain.

287
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:22,063
No, we're going with middle child
and a genetic predisposition...

288
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,732
...to inadequate serotonin production.

289
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,694
Swell, well, how do I play
genetic predisposition?

290
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:31,030
Subtextually, of course.

292
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,244
Just have fun with it.

293
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,626
- Morning, Penny.
- Hi. How did the intervention go?

294
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,713
Unfortunately, we weren't able
to convince him to go to rehab.

295
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,091
Well, based on what you told me,
I'm not surprised.

296
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,096
But we did convince him
to leave the motel.

297
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,264
Come say hello.

298
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:02,395
Leo, this is Penny,
our friend and neighbor.

299
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,773
Hi, Leo, how are you feeling?

300
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,613
Let me ask you something, Penny.

301
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:17,285
Have you ever woken up in a fleabag motel
covered in your own vomit...

302
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,246
...next to a transsexual prostitute?

303
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:27,295
- No.
- Then don't ask me how I'm feeling.

304
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:30,840
Well, that's Leo.

305
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:35,303
Hey, why don't you tell me
about your showcase last night?

306
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,637
Oh, it was okay, I guess.

307
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,348
Wasn't a big turnout,
but they both seemed to like it.

308
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:44,312
- There were only two people there?
- By the end, yeah.

309
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:47,315
Damn you, Chaplain Horrigan.

310
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,693
I'm sorry?

311
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,820
The Philippines.

312
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,741
1992.

313
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,826
The Subic Bay Naval Station.

314
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,996
A young boy on the cusp of manhood.

315
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:07,543
His only companions,
mongrel dogs and malarial mosquitoes.

316
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:11,047
Desperate and alone,
he reached out to a man...

317
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:15,343
...who promised to introduce him
to a merciful, loving God...

318
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:19,680
...but who instead introduced him
to a gin-pickled tongue...

319
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:23,684
...shoved down his adolescent throat.

320
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,187
What choice did he have...

321
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:32,193
...but to drink, shoot
and snort his pain away?

322
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,821
Don't forget genetic predisposition
towards addiction.

323
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,030
Never been proven.

324
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,574
- There have been studies.
- Not double-blind studies.

325
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,202
How could there be?
Who would be the control group?

326
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,454
As you can see,
detoxing can get pretty ugly.

327
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,706
- Let's give them some privacy.
- Yeah.

328
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,667
Do you wanna come over,
have coffee?

329
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,878
- Sounds good.
- I have a video of me singing last night.

330
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,880
Do you wanna see it?

331
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,675
- Gee, why wouldn't I?
- This is even better...

332
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:59,011
...than you coming to the showcase,
now I get to watch you watch me.

333
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,513
Yeah.

334
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,308
Funny how things work out.

335
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:07,061
But he loved the companionship
and the wisdom...

336
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,730
...that his own father failed to provide.

337
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,608
Your parents made the right decision.

338
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,159
I cannot work like this.

339
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:27,248
<font color="#E86CE4">(MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY
ON TV)</font>

340
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:36,257
This is amazing, just sitting on a couch
watching TV with a woman.

341
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:41,888
Not being drunk or high
or wondering if you're a dude down there.

342
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:47,226
Leo, you are a very sweet,
really funny guy.

343
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,520
You're gonna do okay.

344
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,023
One day at a time, Penny.

345
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,862
One day at a time.

346
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,036
How long is he going to stay here?

347
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,956
He's a homeless drug addict, Leonard,
where is he going to go?

348
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,876
Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying.
