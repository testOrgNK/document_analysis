1
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:05,671
All right,
I'm moving my infantry division...

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,757
...augmented by a battalion of orcs
from Lord of the Rings.

3
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:10,592
We flank the Tennessee volunteers...

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,929
...and the North once again
wins the Battle of Gettysburg.

5
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:17,182
Not so fast. Remember, the South
still has two infantry divisions.

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,643
Plus Superman and Godzilla.

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,687
No, no, no. Orcs are magic.

8
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,355
Superman is vulnerable to magic.

9
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,566
Not to mention,
you already lost Godzilla...

10
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:28,027
...to the Illinois cavalry and Hulk.

11
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:32,406
Why don't you just have Robert E. Lee
charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh?

12
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,158
- You guys ready to order?
- Hang on.

13
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:35,909
Shiva and Ganesh?

14
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:38,579
The Hindu gods
against the entire Union Army?

15
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,456
And orcs.

16
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,124
I'll be back.

17
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,794
Excuse me. Ganesh is the remover
of obstacles and Shiva's the destroyer.

18
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:48,547
When the smoke clears,
Lincoln will be speaking Hindi...

19
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,299
...and drinking mint juleps.

20
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:54,261
My boss says you have to either
order or leave and never come back.

21
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:57,806
What do you recommend for someone
with a man-sized appetite...

22
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:00,434
...from a morning of
weight-training and cardio-funk?

23
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,685
A shower.

24
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:05,064
I'll take the heart-smart platter.

25
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,316
All right, thank you. And Sheldon?

26
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,735
We don't eat here.
I don't know what's good.

27
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,446
- Well, it's all good.
- Statistically unlikely.

28
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,324
Just get a hamburger.
You like hamburgers.

29
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,493
I like the hamburgers
where we usually eat.

30
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,704
You can't make the assumption
that I'll like the hamburgers here.

31
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:23,499
I'm sorry. Give him a hamburger.

32
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,542
Which one,
the classic, the ranch house...

33
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,920
...the barbeque burger
or the Kobe burger?

34
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,005
Can't we just go to Big Boy?

35
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:34,802
- They only have one burger, the Big Boy.
- The barbeque burger's like the Big Boy.

36
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:37,346
In a world that already
includes a Big Boy...

37
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,848
...why would I settle for something
like a Big Boy?

38
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,142
Because you are not at Big Boy.

39
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:45,854
- Fine. I'll have the barbeque burger.
- Make it two.

40
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:48,315
Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.

41
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,901
Hey, Leonard. Hi, guys.

42
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,236
- Hey.
- Hey, Leslie.

43
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:56,115
- I didn't know you ate here.
- We don't. This is a disturbing aberration.

44
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,493
Leslie, this is Penny, she lives across
the hall from Sheldon and me.

45
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:02,412
And walks in quiet beauty
like the night.

46
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:05,082
Howard, I've asked you not to do that.

47
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,627
Leslie and I do research together
at the university.

48
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,004
Oh, wow. A girl scientist.

49
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,465
Yep. Come for the breasts,
stay for the brains.

50
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,634
So I'm glad I ran into you.

51
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,512
The Physics Department string quartet
needs a new cellist.

What happened to Elliott Wong?

53
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:23,100
Switched over to high-energy
radiation research, had a mishap.

54
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:26,186
And now the other guys
are uncomfortable sitting next to him.

55
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,564
- So are you in?
- Yeah, sure. Why not?

56
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:32,109
- We rehearse on Tuesdays at your place.
- Why at my place?

57
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:35,612
Yeah, Department of Energy said
our regular space is kind of a hot zone.

00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,407
- Nice meeting you.
- Yeah, you too.

59
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,784
Leonard, I didn't know
you played the cello.

60
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,120
Yeah, my parents felt
that naming me Leonard...

61
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,581
...and putting me
in advanced-placement classes...

62
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,666
...wasn't getting me beaten up enough.

63
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,586
If you're into music, I happen
to be a human beatbox...

64
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,337

No, no. What, are you kidding?

70
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,441
He asked her out once.
It was an embarrassing failure.

71
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:13,817
Thank you, Sheldon.

72
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,153
I'm sorry.
Was that supposed to be a secret?

73
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:20,115
That's too bad.
You guys would make a cute couple.

74
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,577
- Oh, dear.
- What's the matter?

75
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:24,912
She didn't take my order.

76
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:28,290
How could she take your order
when you're too neurotic to talk to her?

77
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:32,461
Nevertheless,
this will be reflected in her tip.

78
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,966
<font color="#808080">LEONARD</font>: What did Penny mean,
"you'd make a cute couple"?

79
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,801
I assume she meant
the two of you...

80
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:43,513
...would constitute a couple
that others might consider cute.

81
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:49,853
An alternate and less likely interpretation
is that you could manufacture one.

82
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,732
As in, "Look, Leonard and Leslie
made Mr. and Mrs. Goldfarb.

83
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,692
Aren't they adorable?"

84
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,445
If Penny didn't know
that Leslie had turned me down...

85
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:02,824
...then that would mean that she, Penny,
thought I should ask her, Leslie, out...

86
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:05,827
...indicating that Penny had no interest
in me asking her out.

87
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,330
But because she did know
I had asked Leslie out...

88
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,582
...and that she, Leslie,
had turned me down...

89
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,169
...then she, Penny,
could be offering consolation.

90
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:18,340
"That's too bad,
you would have made a cute couple."

00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:22,928
But while thinking,
"Good, Leonard remains available."

92
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,431
You're a lucky man, Leonard.

93

How so?

94

You're talking to one of

- Is it the waitress?
- Penny? What about her?

I saw your pupils dilate
when you looked at her...

00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:38,188
...which, unless you're a heroin addict,
points to sexual attraction.

for breakfast...

...which could give
a positive urine test for opiates...

127

...but certainly not dilate my pupils...

in bringing it up.

00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:36,181
...because they're, you know,
getting busy.

156
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,267
So you're saying
Leonard has a girl in there?

157
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:44,231
Well, either that or he's lost his tie rack
and gotten really into Bryan Adams.

158
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,317
LESLIE <font color="#E86CE4">(FLATLY)</font>:
Oh, Leonard, you magnificent beast.

159
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,448
We really shouldn't be standing here.

160
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,369
This is very awkward.

161
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,872
Oh, come on. You know,
Leonard's had girls over before, right?

162
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,293
Oh, yes. But there's usually planning,
courtship, advance notice.

163
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:10,674
You know, last time, I was able to book
a cruise to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse.

164
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:15,095
Wait, wait. You had to leave the state
because your roommate was having sex?

165
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,306
I didn't have to.
The dates just happened to coincide.

166
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,186
So do you know who's in there?

167
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:26,273
Well, there's Leonard.

168
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:33,780
And he's either with Leslie Winkle
or a 1930s gangster.

169
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,785
Hmm. Good for him.

170
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,413
Good for Leonard.

171
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:43,623
Okay. Night.

172
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,417
No, don't. Wait, hold on.

173
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,920
- What's the matter?
- I don't know what the protocol is here.

174
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,841
Do I stay? Do I leave?

175
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,719
Do I wait to greet them
with a refreshing beverage?

176
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,764
Gee, Sheldon,
you're asking the wrong girl.

177
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,058
I'm usually on the other side
of the tie.

Sheldon.

In the living room.

184
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,468
I just...
I wanted you to know I saw the tie.

185
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,262
Message received.

186
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,017
You're welcome.

00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:48,647
You carry on. Give my best to Leslie.

Leonard!

195
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,350
Hey, what's the matter?

196
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,728
Equations.
Someone's tampered with my equations.

197
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,146
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

198
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,732
Look at the beta function
of quantum chromodynamics.

199
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,984
The sign's been changed.

200
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,485
Oh, yeah.

201
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:20,029
But doesn't that fix the problem
you've been having?

202
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,490
Are you insane?
Are you out of your mind?

203
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:26,035
Are you...? Hey, look, that fixes
the problem I've been having.

204
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,038
You're welcome.

205
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,333
You did this?

206
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:35,503
Yeah. I noticed it when I got up
to get water, so I fixed it.

207
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,757
Now you can show quarks are
asymptotically free at high energies.

208
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,383
Pretty cool, huh?

209
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,845
"Cool"?

210
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:45,847
Listen, I gotta get to the lab.

211
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,016
Thanks for a great night.

212
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,643
Thank you. I'll see you at work.

- What?

214
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,358
- Who told you you could touch my board?
- No one.

215
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:00,069
I don't come into your house
and touch your board.

216
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,572
There are no incorrect equations

Inconsiderate. That is the adjective.
Inconsiderate.

221
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:26,763
You can stare at your board all day,
she's still going to be right.

222
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,556
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>:
I'm not staring, I'm mulling.

223
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,475

- Hi.

225

Pretty good.

226
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,696
Just pretty good? I'd think
you were doing very good.

227
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:48,827
"Pretty, very." There's really no objective
scale for delineating variations of good.

228
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,120
Why do you ask?

229
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:55,124
Well, a little bird told me that
you and Leslie hooked up last night.

230
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,796
- Sheldon!
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>: I'm coming.

231
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,549
So is it serious? Do you like her?

232
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,634
I don't...

233
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:09,681
That's really two different questions.
I'm not...

234
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,599
Sheldon, we have to go.

235
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:16,104
Boy, you're wound awfully tight
for a man who just had sexual intercourse.

00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:21,568
All right, well, I'll talk to you later.
But I am so happy for you, Leonard.

Thank you.

<font color="#E86CE4">(DOOR CLOSES)</font>

239
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,951
What did she mean, she's happy for me?

240
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,746
Is she happy because I'm seeing someone
or because she thinks I'm happy?

241
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,958
Because anyone who cared for someone
would want them to be happy...

242
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,795
...even if the reason for their happiness
made the first person unhappy.

243
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,339
You know, because the second person,
though happy...

244
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,885
...is now romantically unavailable
to the first person.

245
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:51,556
Do you realize I may have to share
a Nobel Prize with your booty call?

246
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,269
You know what?

247
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,021
I'm being ridiculous.

248
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,565
But who cares what Penny thinks?

Leslie is a terrific girl.
She's attractive. We like each other.

00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,653
She's extremely intelligent.

251
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,698
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>: She's not that intelligent.
<font color="#808080">LEONARD</font>: She fixed your equation.

<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>: She got lucky.
<font color="#808080">LEONARD</font>: You don't believe in luck.

253
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,828
I don't have to believe in it
for her to be lucky.

254
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,332
Regardless, I have a chance
at a real relationship with Leslie.

255
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:20,668
I'm not gonna pass that up for
some hypothetical future happiness...

256
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,838
...with a woman who may
or may not want me to be happy...

257
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:27,425
...with the woman
who is currently making me happy.

<font color="#808080">LEONARD</font>: Yeah?

259
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,721
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>:
I still don't care.

260
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,189
Hey, Leslie.

261
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:44,817
Careful, Leonard. Liquid nitrogen,
320 degrees below zero.

262
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,946
Brrrr. Heh.

263
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,995
Why are you smashing
a flash-frozen banana?

264
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:59,207
Because I got a bowl of Cheerios
and I couldn't find a knife.

265
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:05,421
So anyway, hello.

266
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,217
What are you doing?

267
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,636
Just extending the intimacy.

268
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,138
Hey, do you wanna slip over
to the radiation lab...

269
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,141
...and share a decontamination shower?

270
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:24,273
Okay, what exactly do you think's
going on between us?

271
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:29,404
I'm not sure, but I think I'm about
to discover how the banana felt.

272
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:37,537
Neither of us are neuroscientists, but we
both understand the biochemistry of sex.

273
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:41,124
Dopamine in our brains is released
across synapses, causing pleasure.

274
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,085
Stick electrodes in a rat's brain,
give him an orgasm button.

275
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,963
He'll push that thing
until he starves to death.

276
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,007
Well, who wouldn't? Heh.

277
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,050
The difference between us and the rat...

278
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,761
...is you can't stick an electrode
in our hypothalamus.

279
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,430
That's where you come in.

280
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,435
Yeah, well,
I'm just glad to be a part of it. Heh.

281
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:02,812
So, what happens now?

282
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,733
Well, I don't know about your sex drive,
but I'm probably good till New Year's.

283
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,777
Oh.

284
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,571
Okay.

285
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,407
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

286
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:20,371
- You wanna make plans for New Year's?
- Please, you're smothering me.

287
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,415
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

288
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,002
Hey, look. It's Dr. Stud.

289
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,296
Doctor what?

290
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,132
The blogosphere is abuzzing
with news of you and Leslie...

291
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,427
...making the bang, bang music.

292
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,806
- Well, how did it get on the Internet?
- I put it there.

293
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,017
Well, how did you know about it?

294
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,852
A little bird told us.

295
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,814
Apparently, you are a magnificent beast.

296
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,819
Well, that part's true.

297
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,701
I think I may have
misjudged this restaurant.

298
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,995
- No kidding.
- I don't wanna go out on a limb...

299
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:04,373
...but I think we may be looking
at my new Tuesday hamburger.

300
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:08,836
Your old Tuesday hamburger
will be so brokenhearted.

301
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:10,713
Way ahead of you.

302
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:15,426
I was thinking of moving Big Boy to
Thursdays and just dropping Souplantation.

303
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,428
- Really?
- Yeah.

304
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,848
The name always confused me, anyway.
Souplantation.

305
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,850
You can't grow soup.

306
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,773
- So how's everything?
- Terrific.

307
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,944
You'll be happy to know I plan to come
every Tuesday for the foreseeable future.

308
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,030
Really? Oh, yay. Heh.

309
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,700
Who do I speak to about
permanently reserving this table?

310
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,204
I don't know, a psychiatrist?

311
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,040
<font color="#808080">PENNY</font>:
So, hey.

312
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,585
- How are things with you and Leslie?
- Oh.

313
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:52,463
To be honest,
I don't think it's going to work out.

314
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:56,509
Oh, that's too bad.
Well, hey, don't worry.

315
00:18:56,677 --> 00:19:00,138
I'm sure there's someone out there
who's just right for you.

316
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,643
Well, what did she mean by that?

317
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:10,231
Was that just a generic platitude
or was that a subtle bid for attention?

318
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:15,653
You know why this hamburger
surpasses the Big Boy?

319
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,990
This is a single-decker,
whereas the Big Boy is a double-decker.

320
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:23,244
This has a much more satisfying
meat-to-bun-to-condiment ratio.

321
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,581
- Are you even listening to me?
- Of course I'm listening.

322
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:30,418
Blah, blah, hopeless Penny delusion,
blah, blah, blah.

323
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,046
Okay, then.

324
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:38,759
You know, you can grow
the ingredients for soup.
