Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal
from this laptop through our local ISP...

4
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:17,016
...racing down fiber-optic cable
at the speed of light to San Francisco...

geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon, Portugal.

8
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:29,737

via microwave relays back to our ISP...

Yeah, you turned your stereo down

I suppose you could have

Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?

Well, there's always the possibility...

...that a trash can spontaneously
formed around the letter...

62
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:57,527
...but Ockham's Razor would suggest
that someone threw it out.

63
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,988
It's from the Institute
for Experimental Physics.

64
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:03,325
They want us to present our
paper on the properties of supersolids...

65
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,161
...at the Topical Conference
on Bose-Einstein Condensates.

66
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,331
I know. I read it before I threw it out.

67
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,292
Okay, if I may drill down
to the bedrock of my question...

68
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,752
...why did you throw it out?

69
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,798
Because I have no interest in standing in
the Rose Room of the Pasadena Marriott...

70
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,217
...in front of a group
of judgmental strangers...

71
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:24,471
...who wouldn't recognize genius if it were
standing in front of them giving a speech.

72
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,099
Which, if I were there, it would be.

73
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:28,850
I don't know, Sheldon.

74

Condensates parties are legendary.

75
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,314
Forget the parties.

76
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,442
Forget the parties? What a nerd.

77
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,862

that I don't know about?

78
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,991
Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize
with my name on it?

79
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:47,661
Leonard, don't take this the wrong way,
but the day you win a Nobel Prize...

80
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:52,457
...is the day I begin my research on the
drag coefficient of tassels on flying carpets.

Ha, ha, ha. The only thing missing from

00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:01,300

research methodology is so flawed...

83
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,218
Shut up, Howard.

- Sheldon, we have to do this.
- No, we don't.

85
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,348
We have to take in nourishment,
expel waste...

86
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,143
...and inhale enough oxygen
to keep our cells from dying.

87
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,312
Everything else is optional.

author is because we went alphabetically.

I let you think we went alphabetically...

92
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,825
...to spare you dealing
with the fact that it was my idea.

93

You're welcome.

95
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,834
Excuse me, I designed the experiment
that proved the hypothesis.

96
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,419
It doesn't need proving.

97
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:41,340
So the entire scientific community
is just supposed to just take your word?

They're not supposed to,
but they should.

I don't care what you say.

100

I'm going to the conference,
presenting our findings.

101
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,598
And I forbid it.

102

You forbid it?

then nobody is.

104

Are you guys still not talking?

109

Okay, here.
Take this and this and this...

121

- ...and these.
- Is this stuff you want me to try on?

122
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,790
No, this is stuff I want you to throw out.

That's the Bottle City of Kandor.

126
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:07,843
Uh-huh.

127
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:12,639
You see, Kandor was the capital city
of the planet Krypton.

128
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,475
It was miniaturized by Brainiac
before Krypton exploded...

...and then rescued by Superman.

It's a lot cooler
when girls aren't looking at it.

132
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,780
Here, why don't you put these on
while I find a shirt and sport coat?

133
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,616
- Great, be right back.

135
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,038
- No, I'm not shy.
- Don't worry, I won't look.

136
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:40,542
I know you won't. Why would you look?
There's nothing to see. Not noth...

137
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,503
- Sweetie, put the pants on.
- I'm gonna put them on.

138
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,924
So, you know, isn't there some way
you and Sheldon could compromise...

139
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,509
...on this presentation thing?

140
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:52,387
No, no. Scientists do not compromise.

141
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:56,391
Our minds are trained to synthesize facts
and come to inarguable conclusions.

142
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:00,770
Not to mention,
Sheldon is bat-crap crazy.

143

Oh, careful.

145
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,738
That's my original series
Battlestar Galactica flight suit.

146
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,074
Oh, why didn't you wear it
on Halloween?

147
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:16,328
Because it's not a costume.
It's a flight suit.

148
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,832
Okay, all right. Moving on.

149
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,168
Oh, wow, a paisley shirt.

150
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,170
Uh-huh, it goes with my corduroy suit.

151
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:30,342
If you mean it should end up
in the same place, then I agree.

Is this your only tie?

153
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,138
Ah, technically, yes.

154
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:39,935
But if you'll notice, it's reversible.

155
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,896
So it works as two.

156
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,690
Oh, sweetie,
I don't even think it works as one.

157
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,071
- Is this all your clothes?
- Yup, everything since the eighth grade.

158
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,240
The eighth grade?

159
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,200
My last growth spurt.

160
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:59,621
Okay, well,

- Great.
- Yup.

Just the latest copy

Oh, you know, that is so weird
that yours came and mine didn't.

the two of us climbing the stairs in silence.

- Oh, dear God.

Little misunderstanding, huh?

178
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,230
A little misunderstand...?

179
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:11,318
Galileo and the pope
had a little misunderstanding.

180
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,281
Anyway, I was talking
to Leonard this morning...

181
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,700

187

I wonder if I've been experiencing
physiological manifestations...

I'm sure you guys can work this out.

192
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,735
- It's certainly preferable to my plan.
- Which was?

193
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,071
A powerful laxative.

194
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,407
Okay, so you absolutely
should talk to him.

195
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,368
I know Leonard values you as a friend.

196
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,411
He told me without your little idea...

197
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:07,040
...there was no way he could've come up
with this whole experiment thing.

Excuse me. Little idea?

199
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,131
Yeah, he tried to explain it to me.
I didn't really understand it...

200
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:18,259
Of course you didn't.
He said "little idea"?

201
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:21,471
Oh. Well, no.
I mean, not in those words...

202
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,515
In what words, then, exactly?

203
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,183
The exact words aren't really...

204
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,727
- It's more the spirit in which...
- What did he say?

205
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,187
You had a lucky hunch.

206
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:33,358
I've been thinking.
Instead of arguing about this, why...?

207
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,069
Don't you ever speak to me again.

208
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,322
What...?

209
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,076

210
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,881
Okay, I'm leaving for the conference.

- Sheldon, I didn't mean it like that.

212
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,012
- Why did you say it?
- I don't know...

213
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,974
- Were you trying to impress Penny?
- No, no, not at all.

let's present the paper together.

No, no, I didn't say better,
I said less stained.

I just checked the house.
There's probably 20, 25 people in there.

00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,861
- You're kidding.
- Is that all?

All? In particle physics, 25 is Woodstock.

Oh. Well, then, good.

232

I'm nervous.

233

- Okay, joke. Okay.

How about this? Um, okay.

There's this farmer,
and he has these chickens...

236
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,050
...but they won't lay any eggs.

237
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,886
So he calls a physicist to help.

238
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:30,099
The physicist then does some calculations
and he says:

239
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:35,897
"I have a solution, but it only works
for spherical chickens in a vacuum."

and the solid becomes a supersolid...

skipped over the part...

257
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,211
...where I was walking through
the park...

258
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,630
...and I saw these children
on a merry-go-round...

259
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,508
...which started me thinking
about the moment of inertia...

260
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,761
...in gasses like helium at temperatures
approaching absolute zero.

It's just an anecdote. It's not science.

Oh, I see. It was the apple falling
on Newton's head.

263
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,185
Was that just an anecdote?

- No, no, that's true.

I don't need validation from lesser minds.

- Really? So why did you come?

- Yes.

00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,182
I don't understand
what you're unhappy about.

305
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,853
You begged me to come, I came.
There's just no pleasing you.

306
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,647
You're right. I'm the problem,
the one that needs help.

307
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,775
Well, that's not much of an apology,
but I'll take it.

308
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,111
Excuse me.

309
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,197
Is there anything you'd like
to apologize for?

310
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,533
Yes. Ahem.

311
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,619
I'm sorry I tried to blow up your head.

312
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,789
It was uncalled for.

313
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,458
You won't believe this.

314
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,878
Somebody got the whole thing
on their cell phone and put it on YouTube.

315
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,796
What?

316
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,925
- Now, who would do that?
- That would be me.

317
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,470
Check it out. It's a featured video.

318
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,305
You hit me. You saw that. He hit me.

319
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,724
- You tried to blow up my head.
- So it was working.

320
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,435
- It was not... You are a nutcase.
- We'll see about that.

321
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:46,105
You people in the front row, heads up.
This is a splash zone.

322
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:50,401
Stop it. Quit it. Quit it.

323

324
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:56,115
- Hit you with a Vulcan nerve pinch.
- No pinches. No...!

325
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,160
You should clip your fingernails.
Those hurt.

326
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,329
Oh, jeez.

327
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,956
Does this suit really look that bad?

328
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,000
Forget your suit.
Look at my arms waving.

329
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,711
I'm like a flamingo on Ritalin.

330
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,174
Howard, would you like
to explain to me...

331
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:17,178
...why your Facebook page has a picture
of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned:

332
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,013
"Me and my girlfriend"?

333
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:23,559
Uh-oh, here comes the talk.

334
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,654
- He hit me.
- You tried to blow up my head.

335
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,448
- So it was working.
- It was not... You are a nutcase.

336
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,699
We'll see about that.

337
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,119
