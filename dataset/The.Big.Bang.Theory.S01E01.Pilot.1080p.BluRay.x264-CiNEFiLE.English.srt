<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>: If a photon is directed through a plane
with two slits in it and either is observed...

2
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:08,841
...it will not go through both.
If unobserved, it will.

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,261
If it's observed after it left the plane,
before it hits its target...

4
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:15,264
- ...it will not have gone through both slits.
- Agreed.

<font color="#808080">LEONAND</font>: What's your point?

6
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:19,685
There's no point,
I just think it's a good idea for a T-shirt.

7
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:27,860
- Excuse me.
- Hang on.

8
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:34,283
One across is Aegean,
eight down is Nabokov.

9
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,952
Twenty-six across is MCM.

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,162
Fourteen down is...

11
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,164
Move your finger.

12
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:43,167
...phylum, which makes 14 across
Port-Au-Prince.

13
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:48,630
See, Papa Doc's capital idea,
that's Port-Au-Prince.

14
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,883
Haiti.

15
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,177
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

16
00:00:55,513 --> 00:01:00,184
Um, is this the high-IQ sperm bank?

17
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:04,021
If you have to ask,
maybe you shouldn't be here.

18
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:07,191
I think this is the place.

19
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,359
- Fill these out.
- Thank you.

20
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,695
- We'll be right back.
- Oh, take your time.

21
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:14,531
I'll just finish my crossword puzzle.

22
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,367
Oh, wait.

23
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,713
Leonard, I don't think I can do this.

24
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:32,508
What, are you kidding? You're a semipro.

25
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,469
No. We are committing genetic fraud.

26
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:38,847
There's no guarantee our sperm's
going to generate high-IQ offspring.

27
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,015
Think about that.

28
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:44,520
I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix
who hostesses at Fuddruckers.

29
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,814
Sheldon, this was your idea.

30
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:50,192
A little extra money to get
fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment?

31
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,695
I know.
And I do yearn for faster downloads.

32
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,199
There's some poor woman
who's gonna pin her hopes on my sperm.

33
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,369
What if she winds up with a toddler
who doesn't know if he should use...

34
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:04,039
...a differential to solve for the area
under a curve?

35
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,793
- I'm sure she'll still love him.
- I wouldn't.

36
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,004
Well, what do you wanna do?

37
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,590
- I want to leave.
- Okay.

38
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,968
- What's the protocol for leaving?
- I don't know.

39
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,263
I've never reneged
on a proffer of sperm before.

40
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,640
Let's try just walking out.

41
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,725
Okay.

42
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,862
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

43
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,446
Nice meeting you.

44
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,411
- Are you still mad about the sperm bank?
- No.

45
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:46,373
You wanna hear an interesting thing
about stairs?

46
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,916
Not really.

47
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:51,086
If the height of a step is off
by as little as two millimeters...

48
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,423
- ...most people will trip.
- I don't care.

49
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,092
Two millime...? That doesn't seem right.

50
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,803
It's true.
I did a series of experiments when I was 12.

51
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,722
My father broke his clavicle.

52
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,766
Is that why they sent you
to boarding school?

53
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,644
No. That was the result
of my work with lasers.

00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,609
I go ahead and smile

56
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:14,860
New neighbor?

57
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,278
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>:
Evidently.

58
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:19,615
Significant improvement
over the old neighbor.

59
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:23,577
Two-hundred pound transvestite

Oh, hi.

00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,583
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,211
Hi?

63
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,047
We don't mean to interrupt.
We live across the hall.

64
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,632
Oh, that's nice.

65
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,135
No. We don't live together. I mean...

66
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:45,474
...we live together, but in separate,
heterosexual bedrooms.

67
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:48,143
Okay, well, guess I'm your new neighbor.

68
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,437
- Penny.
- Leonard. Sheldon.

00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,231
- Hi.
- Hi.

70
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,149
Hi.

71
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,110
Well...

Oh, welcome to the building.

00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,490
Oh, thank you.
Maybe we can have coffee sometime.

- Oh, great.
- Great.

75
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,576
- Great.
- Great.

76
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,746
Well, bye.

77
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,873
- Bye.
- Bye.

78
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,253
Should we have invited her for lunch?

79
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,464
No. We're gonna start season two
of Battlestar Galactica.

80
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,259
We already watched
the season two DVDs.

81
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,052
Not with commentary.

82
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,847
I think we should be good neighbors.

83
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,849
Invite her over, make her feel welcome.

84
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:31,687
We never invited Louie/Louise over.

85
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,147
Well, and that was wrong of us.

86
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,649
We need to widen our circle.

87
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,860
I have a very wide circle.

88
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:42,114
I have 212 friends on MySpace.

89
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,492
Yes, and you've never met one of them.

90
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,452
That's the beauty of it.

91
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,707
I'm gonna invite her over.

92
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,584
We'll have a nice meal and chat.

93
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:58,130
Chat? We don't chat,
at least not off-line.

94
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:00,882
Well, it's not difficult.

95
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,676
You just listen to what she says...

96
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:06,471
...and then you say something appropriate
in response.

97
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,932
To what end?

98
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,144
- Hi. Again.
- Hi.

99
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,604
- Hi.
- Hi.

100
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,315
Anyway...

101
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,568
...we brought home Indian food...

102
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,529
...and I know that
moving can be stressful...

103
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,906
...and I find
that when I'm undergoing stress...

104
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:28,368
...that good food
and company can have a comforting effect.

105
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:33,373
Also, curry's a natural laxative and
I don't have to tell you that, you know...

106
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:37,919
...a clean colon is just one less thing
to worry about.

107
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,923
I'm no expert,
but in the context of a lunch invitation...

108
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,760
...you might wanna skip the reference
to bowel movements.

109
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,095
Oh, you're inviting me over to eat?

110
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,181
Yes.

111
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,433
Oh, that's so nice. I'd love to.

112
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,601
Great.

113
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,103
So, what do you guys do for fun
around here?

114
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,731
Well, today we tried masturbating
for money.

115
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,636

- Okay.

116
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:31,264

You're very welcome.

118
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:37,396
This looks like some serious stuff.
Leonard, did you do this?

119
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,981
Actually, that's my work.

120
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,525
Wow.

121
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:44,111
Yeah, well, it's just some
quantum mechanics...

122
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:48,115
...with a little string theory doodling
around the edges. That part's just a joke.

123
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:51,493
It's a spoof of the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation.

124
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,914
So you're, like, one of those
Beautiful Mind genius guys.

125
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,500
Yeah.

126
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,752
This is really impressive.

127
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,172
I have a board, if you like boards.
This is my board.

128
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,299
Holy smokes.

129
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:09,761
If by "holy smokes," you mean
a derivative restatement of the stuff...

130
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:13,306
...you can find scribbled on the wall
of any men's room at MIT, sure.

131
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,308
- What?
- Oh, come on.

132
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:19,104
Who hasn't seen this differential below
"here I sit brokenhearted"?

133
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:23,316
At least I didn't have to invent 26
dimensions just to make the math come out.

134
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:26,236
- I didn't invent them. They're there.
- In what universe?

135
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,196
In all of them, that is the point.

136
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,032
Do you guys mind if I start?

137
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,868
- Penny.
- Yeah?

138
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:35,162
That's where I sit.

139
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,831
So sit next to me.

140
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,295
- No, I sit there.
- What's the difference?

141
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,047
- What's the difference?
- Here we go.

142
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:49,426
In winter, that seat is close enough
to the radiator to remain warm...

143
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,803
...yet not so close
as to cause perspiration.

144
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:56,183
In the summer, it's in a cross breeze created
by opening windows there and there.

145
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:00,437
It faces the television at an angle that is
neither direct, discouraging conversation...

146
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:03,064
...nor so far wide
as to create a parallax distortion.

147
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:07,319
I could go on,
but I think I've made my point.

148
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,947
Do you want me to move?

149
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,949
- Well...
- Just sit somewhere else.

150
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,828
Fine.

151
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,681
Sheldon, sit.

152
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,267
Ah.

153
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:44,397
Well, this is nice.
We don't have a lot of company over.

154
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:47,108
That's not true.
Koothrappali and Wolowitz come over.

155
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:48,276
Yes, I know.

00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,573
- Yeah, I remember.
- I resent you saying we don't have company.

158
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,493
- That has a negative social implication.
- I said I'm sorry.

159
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:58,954
So...

160
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,497
...Klingon Boggle?

161
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:05,252
Yeah. It's like regular Boggle,
but in Klingon.

162
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,590
That's probably enough about us.
So tell us about you.

163
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,051
Me? Okay.

164
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,805
I'm a Sagittarius, which probably tells you
way more than you need to know.

165
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:20,433
Yes, it tells us that you participate
in the mass cultural delusion...

166
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:23,645
...that the sun's position relative
to arbitrary constellations...

167
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:27,107
...at the time of your birth
somehow affects your personality.

168
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,069
Participate in the what?

169
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,071
I think what Sheldon's trying to say...

170
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,991
...is that Sagittarius wouldn't have been
our first guess.

171
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,827
Oh, yeah, a lot of people
think I'm a water sign.

172
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,371
Okay, let's see, what else?

173
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,581
Oh, I'm a vegetarian.

174
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:46,793
No, except for fish,
and the occasional steak. I love steak.

175
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:49,838
Well, that's interesting.

176
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,590
Leonard can't process corn.

177
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,013
So do you have some sort of a job?

178
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,222
<font color="#808080">PENNY</font>:
Oh, yeah.

179
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,391
I'm a waitress
at The Cheesecake Factory.

180
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,351
I love cheesecake.

181
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,896
- You're lactose intolerant.
- I don't eat it, I think it's a good idea.

182
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,317
Anyways, I'm also writing a screenplay.

183
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:13,903
It's about this sensitive girl who comes
to L.A. from Lincoln, Nebraska...

184
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:18,283
...to be an actress and winds up
a waitress at The Cheesecake Factory.

185
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,577
So it's based on your life.

186
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,746
No, I'm from Omaha.

187
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,335
If that was a movie, I would go see it.

188
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,711
I know, right?

189
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,588
Okay, let's see, what else?

190
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,758
I guess that's about it.

191
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,552
That's the story of Penny.

192
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,721
Well, it sounds wonderful.

193
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,265
It was.

194
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,935
Until I fell in love with a jerk.

195
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,440
What is happening?

196
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,609
<font color="#E86CE4">(MOUTHS)</font>
I don't know.

197
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,028
Oh, God, you know,
four years I lived with him.

198
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,365
Four years.
That's like as long as high school.

199
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:01,034
It took you four years
to get through high school?

200
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:06,748
I just... I can't believe I trusted him.

201
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,254
Should I say something?
I feel I should say something.

202
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,090
You? No, you'll only make it worse.

203
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,425
You wanna know the most pathetic part?

204
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:21,137
Even though I hate his lying,
cheating guts...

205
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,765
...I still love him.

206
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:24,974
Is that crazy?

207
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,810
Yes.

208
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,523
No, it's not crazy. It's a...

209
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,400
It's a paradox.

210
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:36,945
Paradoxes are part of nature.
I mean, think about light.

211
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:41,700
If you look at Huygens, light is a wave,
as confirmed by the double-slit experiments.

212
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,202
But then, along comes Albert Einstein...

213
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,330
...and discovers that light
behaves like particles too.

214
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,502
Well, I didn't make it worse.

215
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,463
Oh, I'm so sorry I'm such a mess.

216
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:58,341
And on top of everything else,
I'm all gross from moving...

217
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,260
...and my stupid shower doesn't work.

218
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,595
Our shower works.

219
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,432
Really? Would it be totally weird
if I used it?

220
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,641
- Yes.
- No.

221
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:07,809
- No?
- No.

222
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,227
No.

223
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,020
It's right down the hall.

224
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,397
Okay, thanks.

225
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,149
You guys are really sweet.

226
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,491

It has been some time...

229
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,791
...since we've had a woman
take her clothes off in our apartment.

230
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,960
That's not true.
Remember at Thanksgiving...

231
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,172
...my grandmother with Alzheimer's
had that episode?

232
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:42,177

we've had a woman take her clothes off...

we didn't wanna rip our eyes out.

was watching her carve that turkey.

are you trying to accomplish here?

236
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:54,939
Excuse me?

237
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,692
That woman in there
is not going to have sex with you.

238
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,861
Well, I'm not trying to have sex with her.

239
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,739
Oh, good.
Then you won't be disappointed.

240
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,241
What makes you think
she wouldn't have sex with me?

241
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,368
I'm a male and she's a female.

242
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,997
Yes, but not of the same species.

243
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,249
I'm not gonna engage
in hypotheticals here.

244

- I'm just trying to be a good neighbor.
- Oh, of course.

245
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,381
That's not to say that
if a carnal relationship were to develop...

246
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,051
...that I wouldn't participate.

247
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,804
However briefly.

248
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,307
Do you think this possibility
will be hindered...

249

"no more tears" shampoo?

- So she's available for coitus?

and you didn't have to come.

309
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,905
Oh, yes. I could have stayed behind
to watch Wolowitz hit on Penny...

310
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,408
...in Russian, Arabic and Farsi.

311
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,451
And why can't she get her own TV?

312
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,578
Come on, you know how it is
with breakups.

313
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:40,039
No, I don't, and neither do you.

314
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,250
But I... I broke up with Joyce Kim.

315
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,920
You did not break up with Joyce Kim.
She defected to North Korea.

316
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,631
To mend her broken heart.

317
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,761
This situation is much less complicated.

318
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,597
There's some dispute
between Penny and her ex-boyfriend...

319
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,433
...as to who gets custody of the TV.

320
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,353
- She just wanted to avoid a scene with him.
- So we get to have a scene with him?

321
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,023
No, Sheldon,
there's not going to be a scene.

322
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,858
There's two of us and one of him.

323
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,069
Leonard, the two of us
can't even carry a TV.

324
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,782
So you guys work with Leonard and Sheldon
at the university?

325
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,915
I'm sorry, do you speak English?

326
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:26,127
Oh, he speaks English.
He just can't speak to women.

327
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,296
Really? Why?

328
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,214
He's kind of a nerd.

329
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,510
Juice box?

330
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,601
- I'll do the talking.
<font color="#808080">MAN</font>: Yeah?

331
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,353
- Hi. I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.
- Hello.

332
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:45,980
What did I just...?

333
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,651
- We're here to pick up Penny's TV.
- Get lost.

334
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,195
Okay, thanks for your time.

335
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:55,865
- We're not gonna give up just like that.
- Leonard, the TV's in the building.

336
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:59,035
We've been denied access to the building,
ergo we are done.

337
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:03,081
Excuse me. If I were to give up at the first
hitch, I never would have identified...

338
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:07,168
...the fingerprints of string theory
in the aftermath of the big bang.

339
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,171
My apologies. What's your plan?

340
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,854
It's just a privilege
to watch your mind at work.

341
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:30,441
Come on,
we have a combined IQ of 360.

342
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,694
We should be able to figure out
how to get into a stupid building.

343
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,573
<font color="#E86CE4">(BUZZES)</font>

344
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:41,160
- What do you think their combined IQ is?
- Just grab the door.

345
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,039
<font color="#808080">LEONARD</font>:
This is it.

346
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:46,874
I'll do the talking.

347
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,752
Good thinking, I'll just be the muscle.

348
00:18:56,885 --> 00:19:00,096
- Yeah?
- I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.

349
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,056
From the intercom.

350
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,852
How the hell did you get in the building?

351
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,396
We're scientists.

352
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,567
Tell him about our IQ.

353
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,205
- Leonard.
- What?

354
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:29,584
- My mom bought me those pants.
- I'm sorry.

355
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,253
You're gonna have to call her.

356
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:37,675
Sheldon, I am so sorry
I dragged you through this.

357
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:42,096
It's okay. It wasn't my first pantsing
and it won't be my last.

358
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,931
And you were right about my motives.

359
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,851
I was hoping to establish
a relationship with Penny...

360
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,271
...that might have someday led to sex.

361
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,357
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>:
Well, you got me out of my pants.

362
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:58,279
Anyway, I've learned my lesson.
She's out of my league, I'm done with her.

363
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,614
I've got my work.

364
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:02,742
One day I'll win the Nobel Prize
and then I'll die alone.

365
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,953
Don't think like that.
You're not going to die alone.

366
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:09,123
Thank you, Sheldon.
You're a good friend.

367
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,127
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>: And you're certainly
not gonna win a Nobel Prize.

368
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:17,465
This is one of my favorite places
to kick back after a quest.

369
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,467
They have a great house ale.

370
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:20,635
<font color="#808080">PENNY</font>:
Wow, cool tiger.

371
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:23,763
Yeah, I've had him since Level 10.

372
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,932
His name is Buttons.

373
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,559
Anyway, if you had
your own game character...

374
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,646
...we could hang out,
maybe go on a quest.

375
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:35,107
- That sounds interesting.
- So you'll think about it?

376
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,985
Oh, I don't think
I'll be able to stop thinking about it.

377
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,697
Smooth.

378
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,535
- We're home.
- Oh, my God. What happened?

379
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:52,333
Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards
and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.

380
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,668
I'm so sorry.

381
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:57,296
I really thought if you guys went
instead of me he wouldn't be such an ass.

382
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,048
No, it was a valid hypothesis.

383
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:02,468
That was a valid hypo...?
What is happening to you?

384
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:06,097
Really, thank you so much
for going and trying.

385
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,809
You just... You're so terrific.

386
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:15,189
Why don't you put some clothes on,
I'll get my purse, and dinner is on me, okay?

387
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,524
- Really? Great.
- Thank you.

388
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:17,942
Okay.

389
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,449
You're not done with her, are you?

390
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,537
Our babies will be smart and beautiful.

391
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,874
Not to mention imaginary.

392
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,716
- Is Thai food okay with you, Penny?
- Sure.

393
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,884
We can't have Thai,
we had Indian for lunch.

394
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,470
- So?
- They're both curry-based cuisines.

395
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,348
- So?
- It would be gastronomically redundant.

396
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:52,935
I can see we're going to have to
spell out everything for this girl.

397
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,771
Any ideas, Raj?

398
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,650
Turn left on Lake Street
and head up to Colorado.

399
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,445
I know a wonderful little sushi bar
that has karaoke.

400
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:04,572
Oh, that sounds like fun.

401

Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me

Oh, baby, baby
Don't get hooked on me

403
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:19,420
I don't know your odds
in the world as a whole...

404
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:23,883
...but as far as the population of this car
goes, you're a veritable mac daddy.

405
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,303
Baby, don't get hooked on me
