after symptoms appear...

00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:04,491
Well, once, when I was 15
and spending the summer...

206
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,785
...at the Heidelberg Institute in Germany.

- Studying abroad?
- No, visiting professor.

208
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:16,795
Anyway, the local cuisine was a little more
sausage-based than I'm used to...

209
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,088
...and the result
was an internal blitzkrieg...

00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:23,009
...with my lower intestine
playing the part of Czechoslovakia.

211
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,762
And there was no one there
to take care of you?

212
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,390
No, my mom had to fly back to Texas
to help my dad...

213
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:33,269
...because the house had slipped off
the cinder blocks again.

- It was tornado season.

And it was an aluminum house.

216
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:44,113
Anyway, the housekeeper in the faculty
residence didn't speak any English.

217
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,699
When I finally managed
to convince her I was sick...

218
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:50,245
...she said,
"Möchtest du eine Darmspülung?"

What does that mean?

220
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,792
Based on what happened next, I assume
it means, "Would you like an enema?"

Okay, sweetie. I'll take care of you.

305
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,659
That's it. Now just keep true.

306
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:28,291
All right, you're close enough
to Sheldon's room. Deploy the sensor.

307
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,294
Now turn it on.

308
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:34,005
- It wasn't on?
- No.

309
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,132
Then why did I have to crawl?

310
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,510
Oh, I guess you didn't.

311
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:43,848
Okay, it's on.

312
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:47,768
Good. From this point forward,
you will have to crawl.

313
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,063
I know.

314
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,025
<font color="#E86CE4">(BEEPING)</font>

315
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,902
Hang on,
the sensor's picking up something.

316
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,778
Turn your head back.

317
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,870
You rat bastard.

318
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,582
<font color="#808080">HOWARD</font>:
Told you the sensor would work.

319
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:11,918
Hi.

320
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,128
You deliberately stuck me with Sheldon.

321
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,631
Come on, I had to.
You see what he's like.

322
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,467
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>:
Penny? Penny, I'm hungry.

323
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,802
It's okay, sweetie. Good news.

324
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,721
- Leonard's home.
- No.

325
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,474
- Here you go, good luck, bye.
- Oh, wait, wait.

326
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:31,395
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>: Leonard? I'm hungry.
- Wait. Penny, take me with you.

327
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,485
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>:
Leonard?

328
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,865
I want grilled cheese.

329
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:05,179
Do you think Penny will come here
and take care of us?

330
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,517
I don't think Penny's
ever coming here again.

331
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:15,022
I'm very congested.

332
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,858
Yeah? So?

333
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:22,822
Can you go to the kitchen and get me
the turkey baster labeled, "Mucus"?

334
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,953
If I stand, I'll vomit.

335
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:32,498
Under the sink. Yellow Tupperware bowl.
