1
00:00:02,627 --> 00:00:05,004
Ooh, more details
about the new Star Trek film.

2
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:09,341
There's going to be a scene
depicting Spock's birth.

3
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:13,095
I'd be more interested in a scene
depicting Spock's conception.

4
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:19,268
Oh, please. For Vulcans, mating,
or, if you will, Pon farr...

5
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:22,688
- ...it's an extremely private matter.
- I'd like to know the details.

6
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,983
His mother was human. His father
was Vulcan. They couldn't conceive.

7
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:29,194
Maybe they had to go to a clinic.
Can you imagine Spock's dad...

8
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:33,073
...with a copy of
Pointy Ears and Shapely Rears?

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,411
How come on Star Trek
everybody's private parts are the same?

10
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:42,207
No alien lady ever told Captain Kirk,
"Hey, get your thing out of my nose."

11
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:43,459
<font color="#E86CE4">(KNOCKS ON DOOR)</font>

12
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,419
Hi. Can you help me?

13
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,880
I was writing an e-mail
and the A key got stuck.

14
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,716
Now it's just going, "Aaaah."

15
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,218
- What'd you spill on it?
- Nothing.

16
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:55,554
Diet Coke.

17
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:58,807
And yogurt.

18
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,225
And a little nail polish.

19
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,019
I'll take a look at it.

20
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,980
Gentlemen, switching
to local nerd news...

21
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:08,067
...Fishman, Chen, Chaudury and McNair
aren't fielding a team...

22
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,110
...in the Physics Bowl this year.

23
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:13,155
- You're kidding. Why not?
- They formed a barbershop quartet...

24
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,492
...and got a gig playing
Knott's Berry Farm.

25
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,830
Wow. So in your world,
you're like the cool guys.

26
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,750
Recognize.

27
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,045
This is our year. With those guys out...

28
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,923
...the entire Physics Bowl
will kneel before Zod.

29
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,842
- Zod?
- Kryptonian villain. Long story.

30
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,344
Good story.

31
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,933
- Count me out.
- What? Why?

32
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,311
You want me to use my intelligence
in a tawdry competition?

33
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:48,065
Would you ask Picasso
to play Pictionary?

34
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:51,360
Would you ask Noah Webster
to play Boggle?

35
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:54,780
Would you ask Jacques Cousteau
to play Go Fish?

36
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,742
Come on, you need a four-person team.
We're four people.

37
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,912
By that reasoning we should also
play bridge, hold up a huppah...

38
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,040
...and enter the Olympic bobsled
competition.

39
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,209
Tickets to that, please.

40
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:12,131
Sheldon, what? Do I need to quote
Spock's dying words to you?

41
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,382
No, don't.

42
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,009
"The needs of the many..."

43
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,220
"Outweigh the needs of the few..."

44
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,222
"Or the one."

45
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,474
Damn it, I'll do it.

46
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,794
Okay, first order
of Physics Bowl business.

47
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:55,007
We need a truly kick-ass team name.
Suggestions?

48
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,552
How about the Perpetual Motion Squad?

49
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,848
It's beyond the laws of physics,
plus a little heads up for the ladies.

50
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,018
- The ladies?
- Perpetual Motion Squad...

51
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,520
...we can go all night.

52
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,564
- I like it.
- I don't.

53
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,275
Teams are traditionally named after
fierce creatures...

54
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,569
...thus intimidating one's opponent.

55
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,237
We could be the Bengal Tigers.

56
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,364
Poor choice. Gram for gram...

57
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:23,619
...no animal exceeds the relative
fighting strength of the army ant.

58
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:28,457
Maybe so, but you can't incinerate
a Bengal tiger with a magnifying glass.

59
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,170
Let's put it to a vote.

60
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,172
- All those in favor...
- Point of order.

61
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,549
I move that any vote on team names
be unanimous.

62
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,844
No man should be forced to emblazon
his chest with a Bengal tiger...

63
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:44,181
...when common sense dictates
it should be an army ant.

64
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,684
Will the gentleman from the great
state of denial yield for a question?

65
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,687
- I will yield.
- After we go through the exercise...

66
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:53,982
...of an annoying series of votes,
which the gentleman will lose...

67
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,568
...does he intend to quit
if he does not get his way?

68
00:03:56,736 --> 00:04:00,113
- He does.
- We are the Army Ants. All those in favor?

69
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,494
Good afternoon and welcome
to today's Physics Bowl practice round.

70
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,704
I'm Penny,
and I'll be your host because...

71
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:10,791
...I didn't have anything else
to do on a Saturday afternoon...

72
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,543
...and isn't that just a little sad?

73
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,672
- Gentlemen, are you ready?
<font color="#808080">LEONARD</font>: Yes.

74
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,966
<font color="#808080">HOWARD</font>: Fire away.
- It's none of my business...

75
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:22,344
...but is a guy who can't speak
in front of women gonna hold you back?

76
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,222
Oh, he'll be okay once the women
are mixed into the crowd.

77
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,934
He only has a problem
when they're one-on-one and smell nice.

78
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,436
Oh, thanks, Raj. It's vanilla oil.

79
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:35,023
I was actually the one who noticed.
Okay, let's just start.

80
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,651
Okay, the first question
is on the topic of optics.

81
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,070
"What is the shortest light pulse
ever produced?"

82
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,280
<font color="#E86CE4">(BUZZER SOUNDS)</font>

83
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,825
- Dr. Cooper.
- Of course, the answer is 130 attoseconds.

84
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,035
- That is correct.
- I knew that too.

85
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,580
Good for you, sweetie.
Okay, next question.

86
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:54,459
"What is the quantum-mechanical effect
used to encode data on hard-disk drives?"

87
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,669
<font color="#E86CE4">(BUZZER SOUNDS)</font>

88
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:59,089
- Howard?
- The answer is giant magnetoresistance.

89
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,341
- Right.
- Hey, I buzzed in.

90
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,052
And I answered. It's called teamwork.

91
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:09,308
Don't you think I should answer
engineering questions? I am an engineer.

92
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:14,313
By that logic, I should answer anthropology
questions because I'm a mammal.

93
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,108
Just ask another one.

94
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,401
Okay.

95
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:23,905
"What artificial satellite has seen glimpses
of Einstein's predicted 'frame dragging'?"

96
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,115
<font color="#E86CE4">(BUZZER SOUNDS)</font>

97
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,409
And, of course, it's Gravity Probe B.

98
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,329
Sheldon, you have to let
somebody else answer.

99
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,789
- Why?
- Because it's polite.

100
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,752
What do manners have to do with it?
This is war.

101
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,838
Were the Romans polite
when they salted Carthage...

102
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,466
...to make sure
nothing would ever grow again?

103
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:46,303
Leonard, you said
I only had to ask questions.

104
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,265
The objective is to give correct answers.

105
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,392
If I know them,
why shouldn't I give them?

106
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,312
Some of us might have
the correct answers too.

107
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,231
- Please. You don't even have a Ph.D.
- All right, that's it.

108
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,692
- Howard, sit down.
- Okay.

109
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,155
- We should take a little break.
- Good idea. I need my wrist brace.

110
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:08,617
All this button pushing is aggravating
my old Nintendo injury.

<font color="#E86CE4">(WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY)</font>

112
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,036
I agree.

113
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,245
What did he say?

114
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:17,376
He compared Sheldon to a disposable
feminine cleansing product...

115
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,170
...one might use on a summer's eve.

116
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,966
Yeah, and the bag it came in.

117
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,014
Leonard, excellent.
I wanna show you something.

118
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,058
Can it wait? I need to talk to you.

119
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,353
Just look. I've designed
the perfect uniforms for our team.

120
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:39,106
The colors are based
on Star Trek: The Original Series.

121
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:43,527
The three of you will wear support red
and I will wear command gold.

122
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:45,946
Why do they say "AA"?

123
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,656
Army Ants.

124
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:52,828
Isn't that confusing? AA might mean
something else to certain people.

125
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:57,582
Why would a Physics Bowl team
be called Anodized Aluminum?

126
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:58,959
No, I meant...

127
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,920
Never mind.

128
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,797
Hey, check it out.

129
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:07,092
I got you a Batman cookie jar.

130
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,345
Oh, neat. What's the occasion?

131
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,640
Well, you're a friend
and you like Batman and cookies...

132
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,308
...and you're off the team.

133
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,021
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>:
What?

134
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,524
Howard, Raj and I
just had a team meeting.

135
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,860
- You didn't.
- We did. I just came from there.

136
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:28,530
I don't know where you just came from.
It couldn't have been a team meeting.

137
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:32,617
I'm on the team and I wasn't there.
Ergo, the team did not meet.

138
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:35,912
Okay, let me try it this way.

139
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,832
I was at a coffee klatch
with a couple of friends...

140
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,711
...and one thing led to another
and, it turns out, you're off the team.

141
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,840
- Why?
- Because you're taking all the fun out of it.

142
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:50,969
I'm sorry, is the winner of the Physics Bowl
the team that has the most fun?

143
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,762
Okay. Let me try it this way.

144
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,641
You're annoying and no one wants
to play with you anymore.

145
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,061
I see.

146
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:06,401
Well, at this point I should inform you
that I intend to form my own team...

147
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,946
...and destroy the molecular bonds
that bind your very matter together...

148
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:14,242
...and reduce the resulting
particulate chaos to tears.

149
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,704
Thanks for the heads up.

150
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,123
You're welcome.

151
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,584
- One more thing.
- Yes?

152
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,794
It's on, bitch.

153
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:36,806
- So who did he get to be on his team?
- He won't say.

154
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:40,810
He just smiles
and eats macaroons out of his Bat-Jar.

155
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:45,440
He's using psychological warfare.
We must reply in kind.

156
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,276
I say we wait until he looks at us,
then laugh like:

157
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,779
"Yes, you are a smart
and strong competitor.

158
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,614
But we are also smart and strong...

159
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:56,201
...and we have a reasonable chance
of defeating you."

160
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,621
How exactly would that laugh go?

161
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,292
Hee-hee-hee!

162
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:05,794
That sounds more like:

163
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:11,466
"We are a tall, thin woman who wants
to make a coat out of your dalmatians."

164
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:16,179
Guys, let's remember that Sheldon
is still our friend and my roommate.

165
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,389
So?

166
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,058
So nothing. Let's destroy him.

167
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,852
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>:
Gentlemen.

168
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,355
<font color="#808080">RAJESH</font>:
Hee-hee-hee!

169
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,988
Okay, we're gonna need a strong fourth
for our team.

170
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:36,950
You know who is apparently very smart
is the girl who played TV's Blossom.

171
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,870
She got a Ph.D. in neuroscience
or something.

172
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:45,166
Raj, we're not getting TV's Blossom
to join our Physics Bowl team.

173
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,254
How about the girl from
The Wonder Years?

174
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:54,634
Gentlemen, I believe I've found the solution
to all our problems.

175
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,722
We can't ask Leslie Winkle.

176
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,515
Why? Because you slept together...

177
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:04,477
...and when she was done with you,
she discarded you like last night's chutney?

178
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,691
Yes.

179
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:14,404
- You gotta take one for the team.
- Yeah. Sack up, dude.

180
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,407
Fine.

181
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,994
Here I go, taking one for the team...

182
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,204
...in the sack.

183
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,751
- Hey, Leslie.
- Hi, guys.

184
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:30,253
Ahem. So, Leslie,
I have a question for you...

185
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:34,507
...and it might be a little awkward,
you know, given that I...

186
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,885
Hit that thing.

187
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:43,224
There's no reason to feel uncomfortable
because we've seen each other's faces...

188
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:46,936
...and naked bodies contorted
in the sweet agony of coitus.

189
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:52,275
There's not? Gee, because it sure sounds
like there should be.

190
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:56,905
Any aspects of our sexual relationship,
regarding your preferences...

191
00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:00,492
...your idiosyncrasies, your performance,
are protected by the inherent...

192
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,745
- ...confidentiality of the bedroom.
- That's all very comforting...

193
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,789
...but I'd like to get on my question now.

194
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:09,542
- Proceed.
- We are entering the Physics Bowl...

195
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,795
- ...and we need a fourth.
- No, thanks.

196
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:15,131
I'm really busy with my like-sign dilepton
supersymmetry search.

197
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:18,218
Dilepton shmylepton, we need you.

198
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,136
Sorry.

199
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,639
Well, we tried.

200
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:27,143
We'll just have to face Sheldon
mano y mano y mano a mano.

201
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,604
Wait, you're going up against
Sheldon Cooper?

202
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,273
- Yes.
- That arrogant, misogynistic...

203
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:36,277
...doorknob that told me I should abandon
my work with high-energy particles...

204
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:39,698
...for laundry and childbearing?

205
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,618
She's in.

206
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,664
<font color="#808080">PENNY</font>:
So how do you feel?

207
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,834
Nice and loose? Come to play?
Got your game face on?

208
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,045
- Are you ready?
<font color="#808080">ALL</font>: Oh.

209
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,006
Yeah. You don't have to stay
for the whole thing.

210
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,884
Oh, no, no, I want to.
Sounds really interesting.

211
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,094
Okay.

212
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,309
- Gentlemen.
- Sheldon.

213
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:11,646
- Sheldon.
- Hee-hee-hee.

214
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,858
Sheldon.

215
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,319
I'm just gonna sit down.

216
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,658
So is that your team?

217
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,410
Actually, I don't need a team.

218
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:29,539
I could easily defeat you single-handedly,
but the rules require four.

219
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:34,002
So may I introduce the third-floor janitor,
the lady from the lunch room and...

220
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,089
My Spanish is not good.
...either her son or her butcher.

221
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:39,966
And what about your team?

222
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:43,178
What rat have you recruited
to the S.S. Sinking Ship?

223
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,388
<font color="#808080">LESLIE</font>:
Hello, Sheldon.

224
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,100
Leslie Winkle.

225
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,770
Yeah, Leslie Winkle.
The answer to the question:

226
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,689
"Who made Sheldon Cooper cry
like a little girl?"

227
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:59,778
Yes, well, I'm polymerized tree sap,
and you're an inorganic adhesive.

228
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:03,740
So whatever verbal projectile you launch
in my direction is reflected off of me...

229
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:07,160
...returns on its original trajectory,
and adheres to you.

230
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,121
Oh, ouch.

231
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:13,249
Okay, if everyone could please
take your seats?

232
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,134
Here's your T-shirt.

233
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,555
PMS?

234
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,808
It's a couple days early.

235
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,518
No.

236
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:34,395
It stands for Perpetual Motion Squad.

237
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:36,564
Oh, right, of course.
What was I thinking?

238
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:43,655
Good afternoon, everyone,
and welcome to this year's Physics Bowl.

239
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:48,451
Today's preliminary match
features two great teams:

240
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:53,790
AA versus PMS.

241
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,959
All night long, y'all.

242
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:03,550
Okay, well, let's jump right in.
First question.

243
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:09,055
For 10 points. "What is the isospin
singlet partner of the pi-zero meson?"

244
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,306
<font color="#E86CE4">(BUZZER SOUNDS)</font>

245
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,308
- PMS?
- The eta meson.

246
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,768
Correct.

247
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,230
- Formal protest.
- On what grounds?

248
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:20,525
The Velcro on my wrist brace
caught on my shirt.

249
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,653
Denied. All right, for 10 points.

250
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:27,699
"What is the lightest element on Earth
with no stable isotope?"

251
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:28,992
<font color="#E86CE4">(BUZZER SOUNDS)</font>

252
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,244
- AA?
- And, of course, the answer is technetium.

253
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,121
Terrific.

254
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:37,083
Next question. "What is the force
between two uncharged plates...

255
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,085
...due to quantum vacuum fluctuation?"

256
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,295
<font color="#E86CE4">(BUZZER SOUNDS)</font>

257
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,005
- PMS?
- And Sheldon can suck on...

258
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,257
- ...the Casimir effect.
<font color="#808080">GABLEHAUSER</font>: Correct.

259
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,557
"How does a quantum computer
factor large numbers?"

260
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,766
<font color="#E86CE4">(BUZZER SOUNDS)</font>

261
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,518
- PMS?
- Shor's algorithm.

262
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:56,728
<font color="#808080">GABLEHAUSER</font>:
Correct.

263
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:04,068
Four-point-one-eight-five-five times 10
to the seventh ergs per calorie.

264
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,154
Prévost's theory of exchanges.

265
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,656
Lambda equals one over pi-R-squared N.

266
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,700
Seven hundred and sixty degrees Celsius.

267
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,953
The approximate temperature
of the young lady in the front row.

268
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,956
Mr. Wolowitz,
this is your second warning.

269
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,001
A sigma particle.

270
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:23,588
Yes, assuming the hypothetical planet
has a mass greater than the Earth.

271
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,381
<font color="#808080">GABLEHAUSER</font>:
Correct.

272
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:33,932
Ladies and gentlemen,
I hold in my hand the final question.

273
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:41,356
The score now stands,
AA, 1150, PMS, 1175.

274
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:44,859
So for 100 points and the match...

275
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:49,530
...please turn your attention
to the formula on the screens.

276
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,407
Solve the equation.

277
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,994
Holy crap.

278
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,622
What the hell is that?

279
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,459
It looks like something they found
on the ship at Roswell.

280
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:05,296
- Come on, think. Leslie?
- It's not gonna work if you rush me.

281
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:09,258
- You have to let me get there.
- You are never gonna let that go, are you?

282
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:10,677
Ten seconds.

283
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,139
<font color="#E86CE4">(BUZZER SOUNDS)</font>

284
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,641
PMS?

285
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,852
Sorry, I panicked.

286
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:21,938
Then guess.

287
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,731
Um...

288
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,401
Eight.

289
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,532
Point four.

290
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,909
I'm sorry, that's incorrect.

291
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:39,080
AA, if you can answer correctly,
the match is yours.

292
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,503
He doesn't have it. He's got squat.

293
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,764
AA, I need your answer.

294
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:58,766
<font color="#E86CE4">(BUZZER SOUNDS)</font>

295
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,102
The answer is minus eight pi alpha.

296
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,187
Hang on a second.
That's not our answer.

297
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,314
- What are you doing?
- Answering question.

298
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,692
Winning Physics Bowl.

299
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,112
How do you know anything
about physics?

300
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,700
Here, I am janitor.
In former Soviet Union, I am physicist.

301
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,994
Leningrad Politechnika.

302
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,329
Go, Polar Bears.

303
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,792
That's a delightful little story.

304
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,211
Our arrangement was
you sit and not say anything.

305
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,922
- I answer the questions.
- You didn't answer question.

306
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,342
Hey, look. Now, maybe you have democracy
now in your beloved Russia...

307
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,387
...but on this Physics Bowl team,
I rule with an iron fist.

308
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,847
Ow!

309
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,516
AA, I need your official answer.

310
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,769
- It's not what he said.
- Then what is it?

311
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,104
- I want a different question.
- You can't.

312
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,481
- Formal protest.
- Denied.

313
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,107
Informal protest.

314
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,485
Denied.

315
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,738
- I need your official answer.
- No, I decline to provide one.

316
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,200
That's too bad because the answer
your teammate gave was correct.

317
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,120
That's your opinion.

318
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,875
- All right, the winner of the match is...
- Hang on.

319
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:10,838
Sheldon, is proving you are single-handedly
smarter than everyone else so important...

320
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:14,509
...that you would rather lose by yourself
than win as part of a team?

321
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,970
I didn't understand the question.

322
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,891
- Go ahead.
- The winner is PMS.

323
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,598
Sorry, somebody's sitting there.

324
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,228
- Who?
- My Physics Bowl trophy.

325
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:12,275
That trophy is meaningless.
I forfeited, therefore you did not win.

326
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,527
- I know someone who would disagree.
- Who?

327
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,029
My Physics Bowl trophy.

328
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,408
"Leonard is so smart.

329
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,244
- Sheldon who?"
- All right, that is just very immature.

330
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,579
You're right. I'm sorry.

331
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:27,039
"I'm not!"

332
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,835
- Okay, new contest.
<font color="#808080">LEONARD</font>: What are you doing?

333
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:35,173
I am settling, once and for all,
who is the smartest around here.

334
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,966
- Okay? Are you ready?
- Absolutely.

335
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,593
- Bring it on.
<font color="#808080">PENNY</font>: Okay.

336
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:43,431
"Marsha, Jan and Cindy were
the three daughters in what TV family?"

337
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:48,936
The Brady Bunch.

338
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,731
Okay.

339
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:55,735
"Sammy Hagar replaced David Lee Roth
as the lead singer in what group?"

340
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,450
The Brady Bunch?

341
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,578
Van Halen.

342
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,749
All right. "Madonna was married
to this Ridgemont High alum."

343
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,295
Oh, my God. Sean Penn.

344
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,839
How do you know these things?

345
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:20,635
I go outside and I talk to people.

346
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,138
Okay, here.
"What actor holds the record...

347
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,141
...for being named People magazine's
Sexiest Man Alive?"

348
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,019
- William Shatner.
- Wait.

349
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,689
I don't think it's Shatner.

350
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:36,150
Then it's gotta be Patrick Stewart.

351
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,781
- No.
- Formal protest.

352
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:46,494
All right. "Singer who sang
'Oops!... I Did It Again'?"

353
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,875
Okay.

354
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,545
"Tweety bird thought he saw a what?"

355
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,510
Romulan.

356
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:09,642
Yes. He thought he saw a Romulan.

357
