Well, there's this girl I know
from back in Nebraska, Christy.

27
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:27,169
She called me up,
she's like, "Hey, how's California?"

And I'm like, "Awesome,"
because it's not Nebraska.

00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:32,716
The next thing I know,
she's invited herself to stay with me.

- Eight oh eight.
- Shh.

31
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,972
She got here today
and she's just been in my apartment...

in Omaha, which is every guy in Omaha...

...and washing
the sluttiest collection of underwear...

in my bathroom sink.

Is she doing it one thong at a time
or does she throw it all in?

00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,363
Like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse?

- He really needs to dial it down.
- I know.

So if you don't like this Christy,
why are you letting her stay?

39
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,958
She was engaged to my cousin
while sleeping with my brother...

40
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,417
...so she's kind of family.

No, yeah, she's definitely a whore.

Your friendship means a lot

...we could be out of food

Are you suggesting
that if we let Penny stay...

...we might succumb to cannibalism?

No one ever thinks it'll happen
until it does.

- He's engaging in reductio ad absurdum.

135
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:14,599
It's the fallacy of extending someone's
argument to ridiculous proportions...

00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,853
...and then criticizing the result.
And I don't appreciate it.

here, let's go over the morning schedule.

Plan your ablutions
and bodily functions accordingly.

141
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,870
How am I supposed to

142
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,289

00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,959
- Here you go.
- Thanks, Leonard.

144
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,087
Heh, wrong.

145
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:47,966
I'm listening.

146
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,093
Your head goes on the other end.

147
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,262
- Why?
- It's culturally universal.

148
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,222
A bed, even a temporary bed...

149
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,142
...is always oriented with the headboard
away from the door.

150
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:02,063
It serves the ancient imperative
of protecting oneself against marauders.

151
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,902
- I'll risk it.
- Ooh.

152
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,445
Anything else I should know?

153
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:12,574
Yes. If you use my toothbrush,
I'll jump out that window.

154
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,912
Please don't come to my funeral.
Have a good night.

155
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,583
- Sorry about that.
- That's okay.

156
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:26,129
FYI, his toothbrush is the red one
in the Plexiglas case under the UV light.

157
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:29,716
- Ha. Got it.
- Well, sleep tight.

158
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,676
Thanks.

159
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,432
Funny expression, sleep tight. Ha-ha. Ha.

160
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,019
It refers to
the early construction of beds...

161
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,981
...which featured a mattress suspended
on interlocking ropes, which occasionally...

162
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,692
Sleep tight.

163
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:03,768
What are you doing?

164
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,859
Every Saturday since we've lived in
this apartment I have awakened at 6:15...

165
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,695
...poured a bowl of cereal,
added a quarter cup of milk...

166
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:18,575
...sat on this end of this couch, turned on
BBC America, and watched Doctor Who.

167
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,452
Penny's still sleeping.

168
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,539
Every Saturday
since we've lived in this apartment...

169
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,666
...I have awakened at 6:15,
poured myself...

170
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,960
I know.
Look, you have a TV in your room.

171
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,795
Why don't you have breakfast in bed?

172
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:35,008
Because I am neither an invalid
nor a woman celebrating Mother's Day.

173
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,178
What time is it?

174
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,138
Almost 6:30.

175
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,265
I slept all day?

176
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,726
No, it's 6:30 in the morning.

177
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,896
What the hell is your problem?

178
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,566
Okay, this cereal
has lost all its molecular integrity.

179
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,569
I now have a bowl
of shredded wheat paste.

180
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:58,239
Hola, nerd-migos.

181
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,786
Why do you people hate sleep?

182
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,538
Are you wearing my robe?

183
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,167
Oh, yeah. Sorry, I'll have it cleaned.

184
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,670
That's okay, keep it.

185
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,881
- Where's Christy?
- In the shower.

186
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,384
By the way,
where did you get that loofah mitt?

187
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:20,136
Yours reaches places
that mine just won't.

188
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,518
You used my loofah?

189
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,104
More precisely, we used your loofah.

190
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,898
I exfoliated her brains out.

191
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,985
You can keep that too.

192
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:40,657
Ah. Well, then, we'll probably need to talk
about your stuffed-bear collection.

193
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,244
<font color="#808080">CHRISTY</font>: Howard?
- In here, milady.

194
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:49,082
Mm. There's my little engine that could.

196
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:56,589
There's one beloved children's book
I'll never read again.

197
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,175
Hi. Christy.

198
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,969
- Hey, Leonard.
- I'm Sheldon.

199
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,346
Right. You're Howard's entourage.

200
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,767
So, Christy, what are your plans?

201
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:11,354
Well, Howard said he'd take me shopping
in Beverly Hills.

202
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:15,233
Yeah, no, I meant plans to find
someplace to live other than with me.

203
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,361
Not that I don't love having you,
but it's a little crowded.

204
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,613
Penny, you're always welcome
to stay with us.

205
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:23,825
Oh, terrific.
Now we're running a cute little B & B.

206
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,453
Let me offer a little thinking here.

207
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,748
- Why doesn't Christy stay with me?
- You live with your mother.

208
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,584
I do not. My mother lives with me.

209
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:37,297
It's settled. Christy will stay with Howard,
Penny can go back to her apartment.

210
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,883
And I'll watch the last 24 minutes
of Doctor Who...

211
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,136
...although at this point,
it's more like Doctor Why Bother?

212
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,849
- Sheldon, you just can't dictate...
- No more talking. Everybody go.

213
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:52,437
So, what do you say?
Wanna repair to Casa Wolowitz?

214
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,148
What is that, like a Mexican deli?

215
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,525
I'm sorry,
I should have mentioned this earlier.

216
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,402
My last name is Wolowitz.

217
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,155
Oh. That's so cool.

218
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,699
My first Jew.

219
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:11,247
I imagine there aren't
very many kosher cornhuskers.

220
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,294
- But you're still taking me shopping?
- Anything you want.

221
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,797
Okay, I'll go pack my stuff.

222
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:24,928
When they perfect human cloning,
I'm gonna order 12 of those.

223
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,765
Howard, can't you see she's using you?

224
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,227
Who cares? Last night,
she pulled off her blouse and I wept.

225
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,062
Look, Howard, I know her, okay?

226
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,649
She'll have sex with anyone
as long as they keep buying her things.

227
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,526
- Really?
- Yeah.

228
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,069
Yay.

229
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:48,159
If you'll excuse me,
I have some bar mitzvah bonds to cash.

230
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,837
I'm sorry,
we cannot do this without Wolowitz.

231
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,923
We can't order Chinese food
without Wolowitz?

232
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,383
Let me walk you through it.

233
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,261
Our standard order is,
the steamed dumpling appetizer...

234
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:08,555
...General Tso's chicken,
beef with broccoli...

235
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,099
...shrimp with lobster sauce,
and vegetable lo mein.

236
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,184
Do you see the problem?

237
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,604
I see a problem.

238
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:20,400
Our entire order is predicated
on four dumplings and four entrées...

239
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,069
...divided amongst four people.

240
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:27,073
So we'll just order three entrées.

241
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,825
Fine. What do you wanna eliminate?

242
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,911
- And who gets the extra dumpling?
- We could cut it into thirds.

243
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,538
Then it's no longer a dumpling.

244
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:37,500
Once you cut it open, it is, at best,
a very small open-faced sandwich.

245
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,252
Hi, fellas.

246
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:44,048
Oh. Where's your annoying little friend
who thinks he speaks Mandarin?

247
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,634
He's putting his needs
ahead of the collective good.

248
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,178
Where he comes from,
that's punishable by death.

249
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:52,557
I come from Sacramento.

250
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,897
Can we get an order of dumplings,
but with three instead of four?

251
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,607
No substitutions.

252
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:03,151
This isn't a substitution.
It's a reduction.

253
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,737
Okay. No reductions.

254
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,990
Fine. Bring us three orders of dumplings.

255
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,618
- That's 12, we'll each have four.
- That works.

256
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:14,287
If we fill up on dumplings,
we need to eliminate an entrée.

257
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,663
No eliminations.

258
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,500
If we have extra,
we'll just take the leftovers home.

259
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:23,296
And divide it how? I'm telling you,
we cannot do this without Wolowitz.

260
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,923
Wolowitz is with his girlfriend.

261
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,675
If you'd let me invite Penny,
you would've had your fourth.

262
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,552
Have you seen Penny eat Chinese food?

263
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,013
She uses a fork
and she double-dips her egg rolls.

264
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:35,892
- We don't order egg rolls.
- Exactly. But we'd have to if she was here.

265
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,518
Can we please make a decision?

266
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:42,106
Not only are there children starving in
India, there's an Indian starving right here.

267
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,693
There's an idea.
Why don't we go out for Indian food?

268
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,612
Oh, ew.

269
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,530
You're nice boys.

270
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,992
Tell you what I'm going to do.
I'm gonna bring you the four dumplings.

271
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,869
When I'm walking over to the table...

272
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,914
...maybe I get bumped,
one of the dumplings fall to the floor.

273
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,123
No one has to know.

274
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,085
I'll know.

- Yeah, we can always divide soup.

277
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,220
What about the won tons?

278
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,228
Oh. Hey, guys, what's up?

00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,397
It's "Halo" night.

280
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,649
Yeah? Okay.

281
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,860
So?

282
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:31,364
With Wolowitz spending all of his time
with your friend Christy...

283
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:35,535
She's not my friend. Friends do not
get their friends' Care Bears all sweaty.

284
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:40,331
Right, anyway, uh,
with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere...

285
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,917
...we had something
we wanted to ask you.

286
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,003
- Sheldon?
- Yes. Ahem.

287
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,800
Penny,
we would very much appreciate it...

288
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,594
...if you would be the fourth member
of our "Halo" team.

289
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:58,433
I don't think I need to tell you
what an honor this is.

290
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,020
Oh. That's so sweet.

291
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,230
But I'm going out dancing
with a girlfriend.

292
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,691
You can't go out, it's "Halo" night.

293
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,235
Well, for Penny, it's dancing night.

294
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,362
- You go dancing every Wednesday?
- No.

295
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,822
Then it's not dancing night.

296
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,325
Why don't I play with you tomorrow?

297
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:19,954
Tonight is "Halo" night.
It's like talking to a wall.

298
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:24,500
All right, now, Sheldon,
you and I are about to have a problem.

299
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,421
Sheldon, remember, we role-played this.

300
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,340
Yes, but you didn't portray her
as completely irrational.

301
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,801
All right, fellas, I gotta go.

302
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,054
But good luck.

303
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:42,435
Maybe we should've asked if we could go
dancing with her and her girlfriend.

304
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,812
Okay, assuming we could dance,
which we can't...

305
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,856
...there are three of us and two of them.

306
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:51,319
- So?
- It's the Chinese restaurant all over again.

307
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,489
I assure you that cutting
a dumpling in thirds is child's play...

308
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:58,910
...compared with three men each attempting
to dance with 67 percent of a woman.

309
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,539
For God's sakes, Sheldon,
you are driving me crazy.

310
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:06,042
Your anger is not with me,
but with mathematics.

311
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,960
I'm pretty sure my anger is with you.

312
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,838
What is happening to us?
We're falling apart.

313
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:15,009
- Who are you calling?
- The only man who can restore...

314
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,678
...any semblance of balance
to our universe.

This is Howard.

CHRISTY <font color="#E86CE4">(ON RECORDING)</font>
This is Christy.

317
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:24,936
<font color="#808080">HOWARD</font>: We can't get to the phone
right now because we're having sex.

318
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,398
<font color="#808080">CHRISTY</font>: You're not gonna put that
on your message, are you?

319
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,317
<font color="#808080">HOWARD</font>:
I'm just kidding. I'll re-record it.

320
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,527
<font color="#E86CE4">(BEEPS)</font>

321
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,531
Sheldon, think this through.

322
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:39,700
You're going to ask Howard
to choose between sex and "Halo."

323
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:43,538
No, I'm going to ask him
to choose between sex and "Halo 3."

324
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,124
As far as I know,
sex has not been upgraded...

325
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,460
...to include hi-def graphics
and enhanced weapon systems.

326
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:53,256
You're right, all sex has is nudity,
orgasms and human contact.

327
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,383
My point.

328
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:59,595
<font color="#808080">CHRISTY</font>: I'm just saying you can take the
damn plastic off the couch once in a while.

329
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,889
<font color="#808080">MRS. WOLOWITZ</font>: Why, so you
and Howard can hump on it?

330
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:06,060
<font color="#808080">HOWARD</font>: Ladies, ladies,
I'm sure there's a middle ground.

331
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,479
<font color="#808080">MRS. WOLOWITZ</font>: Shut up, Howard!
<font color="#808080">CHRISTY</font>: Shut up, Howard!

332
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,899
<font color="#808080">HOWARD</font>: You guys talk.
I'm gonna take my scooter out for a spin.

333
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,318
<font color="#808080">CHRISTY</font>: You happy?
You drove your son out of the house.

334
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,237
<font color="#808080">MRS. WOLOWITZ</font>:
Why don't you stop butting in?

335
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,407
- What are you guys doing here?
- It's "Halo" night.

336
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,409

He's not a man, he's a putz.

337
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,828
And don't you take that tone with me,
you gold digger.

338
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:27,039
<font color="#808080">CHRISTY</font>: What'd you call me?
<font color="#808080">MRS. WOLOWITZ</font>: You heard me.

339
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,749
You're barking up the wrong tree...

340
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:32,003
...because as long as you're around,
Howard is out of the will.

341
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,423
<font color="#808080">CHRISTY</font>: You know what?
I got better offers. I'm out of here.

342
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:39,427

Go back to Babylon, you whore.

343
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,849
So "Halo" night, huh?

344
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:49,937
- I thought she was the whore of Omaha.
- Shh.

Sheldon, you got him in your sights. Fire!
He's charging his plasma rifle.

347
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:02,241
- I can't shoot now, I'm cloaking.
- Now, Raj, kill Sheldon.

348
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:03,451
I can't see him.

349
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,120
That's why they call it cloaking,
dead man.

350
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:09,040
- Start throwing grenades.
- I'm all out.

Hey, guys, my friends and I
got tired of dancing...

352
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,378
...so we came over to have sex
with you.

Now, Raj, jump in the tank.

- We said no tanks.
- There are no rules in hell.

Son of a bitch.
Med-pack! I need a med-pack!

Told you.

There's a sniper.
Use your rocket launcher.

All I've got is a needler
and I'm all out of ammo!

And now you're out of life.
