No, it's:

<font color="#E86CE4">(SPEAKING IN MANDARIN)</font>

4
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,265
What's this?

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,101
That's what you did.

6
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:23,564
I assumed, as in a number of languages,
that the gesture was part of the phrase.

7
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:26,316
- Well, it's not.
- Why am I supposed to know that?

8
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:29,987
As teacher, it's your obligation
to separate your personal idiosyncrasies...

9
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,613
...from the subject matter.

10
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,950
- I'm glad you decided to learn Mandarin.
- Why?

11
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:39,038
Once you're fluent, you'll have a
billion more people to annoy instead of me.

12
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:41,707
Hey.

13

<font color="#E86CE4">(SPEAKING IN MANDARIN)</font>

14
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:47,629
You just called Leonard
a syphilitic donkey.

15
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,217
My apologies, Leonard.
I'm only as good as my teacher.

16
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,428
Why are you learning Chinese?

17
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,848
I believe the Szechuan Palace
has been passing off orange chicken...

18
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:01,185
...as tangerine chicken,
and I intend to confront them.

19
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:05,898
If I were you, I'd be more concerned
about what they're passing off as chicken.

20
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:12,196
- I need to use your window.
- Oh, hey. Yeah, no, sure, go ahead.

21
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:16,617
Hey, jerk face. You forgot your iPod.

22
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,746
- What's going on?
- I'll tell you what's going on.

23
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:24,583
That stupid, self-centered bastard
wrote about our sex life in his blog.

24
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,589
Drop dead,
you stupid, self-centered bastard.

25
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,675
Thank you.

26
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,305
Okay, where were we?

27
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:42,059
Not now. I have a blog to find.

28
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,507
Penny, are you okay?

29
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,885
<font color="#808080">PENNY</font>:
I'm fine, Leonard. Just go away.

30
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,472
I understand that breaking up
with someone can be very painful...

31
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,559
- Go away!
- Okay, feel better, bye.

32
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,274
She doesn't wanna talk.

33
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:32,776
Not surprising.

34
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:37,406
Penny's emotional responses originate in the
primitive portion of brain, the amygdala.

35
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:40,367
While speech is centered
in the recently developed neocortex.

36
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,328
Former can overpower the latter
giving scientific credence...

37
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,331
...to the notion
of being rendered speechless.

38
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,964
Or maybe she just doesn't wanna talk.

39
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,510
Hey, look, I found an iPod.

40
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,309
It's smashed beyond repair.
What are you gonna do with it?

41
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:09,188
What else?
Sell it on eBay as slightly used.

42
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,982
It was Penny's boyfriend's.
They broke up.

43
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,028
Apparently, he posted intimate details
of their physical relationship on his blog...

44
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,239
...which I cannot find anywhere.

45
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,910
You know what? I'm gonna go back
and try talking to her again.

46
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:26,121
Good idea.
Sit with her, hold her, comfort her.

47
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:30,500
And if the moment feels right,
see if you can cop a feel.

48
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,921
I'm not going to do that, Howard.

49
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:37,883
I'm not aware of any social convention
that requires you to intervene at all.

50
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,843
What about damsel in distress?

51
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:43,639
Twelfth-century code of chivalry?
Not exactly current.

52
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,767
You'd also have to be knighted
for that to apply.

53
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,853
I don't care.
She's upset, I'm going over there.

54
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:53,398
Remember to sit on your hands a bit
so they're warm.

55
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,819
I'm her friend. I'm not going
to take advantage of her vulnerability.

56
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:02,241
So you're saying, if in the depths of despair
she throws herself at you...

57
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:06,036
...and demands you take her right there,
right now, you'll just walk away?

58
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:09,665
I said I'm her friend, not her gay friend.

<font color="#E86CE4">(KNOCKING ON DOOR)</font>

60
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,505
Hey, I know you said
you didn't wanna talk...

61
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,215
- I don't.
- Okay, sorry.

62
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,301
- Wait.
- Wait. Did you say wait?

63
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,805
Tell me the truth.

64
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:28,058
Am I just an idiot who picks giant losers?

65
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,685
No, no.

66
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:33,397
Okay, so I pick good guys,
but turn them into losers?

67
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:34,606
Of course not.

68
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,734
Well, it's gotta be one or the other.
Which is it?

69
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,993
I'm sorry. What were the choices again?

70
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,287
I really thought Mike was different.

71
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,540
I thought he was sensitive and smart.

72
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,708
I mean, not you smart.

73
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:56,044
- Normal non-freaky smart.
- Yeah, no, sure.

74
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,880
You know, and then he just goes
and has to humiliate me...

75
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:02,676
...by writing about me on his blog
so the entire world can read it.

76
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,928
Actually, it's not all that easy to find.

77
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:08,557
Yeah, really? Well, my friends at work
found it, my sister found it.

78
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:13,770
Judging by my e-mail, a number of prisoners
at the Michigan State Penitentiary found it.

79
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,897
What exactly did this guy write?

80
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,650
Not that I need to know
the details of your sex life.

81
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,027
I just thought...

82
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,112
Never mind.

83
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,072
No, you know what?

84
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,451
Might as well read it,
everybody else has. Go ahead.

85
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:31,038
Oh, God, I just feel so betrayed
and embarrassed.

86
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:34,499
I just wanna crawl into a hole and die.

87
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,172
Okay, well, you know, this isn't that bad.

88
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,800
It just paints the picture
of a very affectionate woman...

89
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:49,306
...who's open to expressing her affection
in nontraditional locales.

90
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,308
Oh, God.

91
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:56,605
Elevators, parks, movie theaters.

92
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,899
Out of curiosity...

93
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:03,236
...is this subway, the transportation system,
or Subway, the sandwich shop?

94
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,239
Sandwich shop.

95
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,659
Doesn't that violate
the health code or...?

96
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,204
No, at the sub shop,
we were only making out.

97
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,289
Ah, okay.

98
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:18,919
But my point is that you have absolutely
no reason to be embarrassed.

99
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:22,297
Really? Do you think I overreacted?

100
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,467
- Maybe a little.
- Because I do that, I do overreact.

101
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,011
- Maybe I should call Mike and apologize.
- No, no.

102
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,722
No, that would be under-reacting.

103
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,476
He did break the implied confidentiality
of the bedroom...

104
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:38,855
...and in your case, the elevator,
parks and fast-food franchise.

105
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,565
Yes, you're right.

106
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,859
I should just say I am done with him.

107
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,820
Yes you should. Go ahead, say it.

108
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:48,073
But I never gave the man a chance
to explain.

109
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,243
What is there to explain?
It's all right here.

110
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,370
It's betrayal.

111
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,789
No, you were right the first time.

112
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,791
This is a man who loves me...

113
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:02,504
...but in his own stupid way was just trying
to show people how he feels.

114
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,091
I'm pretty sure I never said that.

115
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,761
No, you did better than that.
You helped me see it on my own.

116
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,304
Oh, good for me.

117
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,642
- Where are you going?
- I'm going over to Mike's.

118
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,603
- Leonard, thank you so much.
- Oh, sure.

119
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,193
Huh.

120
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,696
Maybe I am her gay friend.

121
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,538
Howard, I'm going
to need another Mandarin lesson.

122
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:40,125
I obviously didn't make my point
with those people.

123
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:43,211
For God's sake,
if you don't like tangerine chicken...

124
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:44,921
...don't order tangerine chicken.

125
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:48,300
I like tangerine chicken.
I'm just not getting tangerine chicken.

126
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,471
- Can we please change the subject?
- Sure.

127
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,892
Tell us again how you screwed up and got
Penny back together with her old boyfriend.

128
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,103
Just roll the dice.

129
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,902
"Enslaved by warlocks.
Stay here till you roll two, four or..."

130
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,778
She was mad at him.

131
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,282
She was done with him,
the relationship was broken...

132
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,660
...and I walked over there and I fixed it.

133
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,623
Boy, that story gets better
every time you hear it.

134
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,752
I thought the first two renditions
were far more compelling.

135
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,421
Previously, I felt sympathy
for the Leonard character.

136
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,591
Now I just find him
to be whiny and annoying.

137
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,969
Just eat your tangerine chicken.

138
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:36,014
I'd love to,
but I don't have tangerine chicken.

139
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:42,437
Thank you so much
for your stupid advice.

140
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,860
Incredible.

141
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,863
You managed to screw up the screw-up.

00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,162
I'm back.

144
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:03,375
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
It's not your fault.

145
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:04,834
What happened?

146
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:08,463
Well, I went over to Mike's
to make up with him...

147
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,632
Yeah, no, I know that part.

148
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,093
But he had already moved on.

149
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,011
Already? That was quick.

150
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:20,058
That's what I said to the woman
who had her legs wrapped around his neck.

151
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,229
Oh, Penny, I am so sorry.

152
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,648
How could he do that?

153
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:30,318
Oh, you know,
you did throw an 80-gig iPod...

154
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,362
Yeah, no, how could he do that?

155
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:36,074
I swear to God,
I am done with guys like that.

156
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:40,203
You know, macho with the perfect body,
and the hair and the money.

157
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,706
Yeah, that must get old quick.

158
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:49,087
You know, just once, I would like to go out
with someone who is nice and honest...

159
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,423
...and who actually cares about me.

164
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,183
What about if you went out with me?

165
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,021
Are you asking me out?

166
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:11,067
Um, yes, I am asking you out.

167
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,696
Wow.

168
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,574
I was just going off your comment
about the nice guy...

169
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,200
- No, I got that.
- And honest...

170
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,952
- Yeah, totally.
- So but...

171
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,412
- It's no big deal.
- Yes.

172
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,498
Yes, what?

173
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,293
Yes, I will go out with you.

174
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,173
Really?

175
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,301
Yeah.

176
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,346
Why not?
I mean, what do I have to lose?

177
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,222
Yeah.

178
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,768
That's the spirit.

179
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,150

185
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,249
I'm sorry.

186
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,002
Look, do you have a second?

187
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,922
A second what? Pair of underwear?

188
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,299
I was just wondering
if I could talk to you.

189
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,509
It's about Leonard.

190
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,845
Why me?
Why not Koothrappali or Wolowitz?

191
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,515
Well, Raj can't talk to me
unless he's drunk.

192
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:27,143
And Wolowitz is, you know, disgusting.

193
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,313
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>:
Yes, I suppose he is.

194
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,025
All I'm saying
is you know Leonard the best.

195
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:38,446
Not necessarily. I'm often surprised
by my lack of familiarity with Leonard.

196
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:43,618
Just the other day, I discovered
he not only has a loofah, he hides it.

197
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,579
Why do you suppose a man
would be ashamed of having a loofah?

198
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:50,166
I myself prefer to have my excess
epithelial cells slough off naturally...

199
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:53,628
...but I don't condemn those
who seek to accelerate the process.

200
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:58,466
And until recently, I had no idea
that despite his lactose intolerance...

201
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:01,136
...he can tolerate small amounts
of nonfat ice cream...

202
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,221
...without producing a noxious gas...

203
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,766
...that, I maintain, in the right concentration
could be weaponized.

204
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,270
Leonard might come home.
Can we talk in my apartment?

205
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,689
We're not done?

206
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,317
- No.
- Eh, why not?

207
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:19,320
We're already through
the looking glass anyway.

208
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,285
Okay, so here's the thing.

209
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,413
I guess you're aware
that Leonard asked me out.

210
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,331
Well, he didn't actually say anything.

211
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,418
But when he came back to the apartment,
he was doing a dance...

212
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,504
...that brought to mind
the happy hippos in Fantasia.

213
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,090
Oh, that's nice.

214
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,509
Anyhow,
the thing I wanted to talk to about is...

215
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:45,054
...you know, since Leonard
and I have become friends, I was just...

216
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,264
Wanna sit down?

217
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,267
Oh, I wish it were that simple.

218
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:54,689
You see, I don't spend much time here,
and so I've never chosen a place to sit.

219
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,775
Well, choose.

220
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,944
There are a number of options and...

221
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,906
I'm really not familiar enough
with the cushion densities...

222
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:07,118
...air-flow patterns and dispersion
of sunlight to make an informed choice.

223
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:11,039
Why don't you pick at random, if you
don't like it, sit somewhere else next time?

224
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,208
No, no, that's crazy.

225
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:18,046
You go ahead and talk
while I figure it out.

226
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:19,964
Okay.

227
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,467
Here's the thing.

228
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:26,971
So I've known for a while now
that Leonard has had a little crush on me...

229
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,890
A little crush?

230
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,475
Well, I suppose so.

231
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:34,479
In the same way Menelaus
had a little crush on Helen of Troy.

232
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,357
I don't really know who they are...

233
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,902
- Menelaus was the brother of Agamemnon...
- Yeah, I don't care. Listen.

234
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,737
The point is...

235
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,657
...Leonard isn't the kind of guy
I usually go out with.

236
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,285
Leonard isn't the kind of guy
anyone usually goes out with.

237
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:53,081
Would you be open
to rotating the couch clockwise 30 degrees?

238
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:57,710
No. What I'm saying is,
Leonard might be different in a good way.

239
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:01,256
And obviously, my usual choices
have not worked out so well.

240
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:05,593
Your last one worked out well
for Koothrappali. He got a free iPod.

241
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,222
Oh, glare.

242
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,765
But on the other hand...

243
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:14,435
...if things don't go well with Leonard,
I risk losing a really good friend.

244
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,354
I mean, he's not looking for a fling.

245
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:20,483
He's the kind that gets into a relationship
for, like you would say, light-years.

246
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:21,776
I would not say that.

247
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:26,573
No one would say that.
A light-year is a unit of distance, not time.

248
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,783
Thank you for the clarification.

249
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,584
Draft.

250
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:41,337
You see, people hear the word "year"
and they think duration.

251
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:45,049
Foot-pound has the same problem.
That's a unit of work, not of weight.

252
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,384
Right. Thanks.

253
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:50,013
- It's a common mistake.
- Not the first one I've made today.

254
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:51,723
Okay.

255
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:55,018
I think this will be my seat.

256
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,854
Do you have anything to say
that has anything to do...

257
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,064
...with, you know,
what I'm talking about?

258
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,650
Well, let's see.

259
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,153
We might consider Schrödinger's cat.

260
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,406
Schrödinger. Is that the woman in 2A?

261
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,824
No, that's Mrs. Grossinger.

262
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:13,494
She doesn't have a cat, she has a Mexican
hairless. Annoying little animal. Yip-yip-yip.

263
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,163
Sheldon.

264
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,665
Sorry, you diverted me.

265
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:22,253
Anyway, in 1935, Erwin Schrödinger,
in an attempt to explain...

266
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:26,090
...the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum
physics, he proposed an experiment.

267
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,886
A cat is placed in a box
with a sealed vial of poison...

268
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,971
...that will break open at a random time.

269
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,934
Now, since no one knows
when or if the poison has been released...

270
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:41,606
...until the box is opened, the cat
can be thought of as both alive and dead.

271
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,196
I'm sorry, I don't get the point.

272
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,407
Well, of course you don't get it.
I haven't made it yet.

273
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,161
You have to be psychic,
there's no such thing...

274
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,871
Sheldon, what's the point?

275
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,708
Just like Schrödinger's cat,
your potential relationship with Leonard...

276
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:03,544
...right now
can be thought of as both good and bad.

277
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:07,674
It is only by opening the box
that you'll find out which it is.

278
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,386
Okay, so you're saying
I should go out with Leonard?

279
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,554
No, no, no.

280
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,142
Let me start again.
In 1935, Erwin Schrödinger...

281
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,355
Two seats right there.

282
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,693
<font color="#E86CE4">(SPEAKING IN MANDARIN)</font>

283
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,077
Sheldon, I think I've made a mistake.

284
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,621
I can see that.
Unless you're running a marathon...

285
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:42,917
...choosing both stuffing and mashed
potatoes is a starch-filled redundancy.

286
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:44,836
No, it's about Penny.

287
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,797
A mistake involving Penny.

288
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,008
Okay, you'll have to narrow it down.

289
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,219
I don't think
I can go out with her tonight.

290
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,721
Then don't.

291
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,223
Other people would say, "Why not?"

292
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,600
Other people might be interested.

293
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,980
- I'm gonna talk anyway.
- I assumed you would.

294
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:09,569
Now that I'm actually about to go out
with Penny, I'm not excited, I'm nauseous.

295
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,529
Then your meal choice is appropriate.

296
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,780
Starch absorbs fluid...

297
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:16,576
...which reduces the amount
of vomit available for violent expulsion.

298
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,620
- Right.
- You also made a grammatical mistake.

299
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,206
You said "nauseous"
when you meant "nauseated."

300
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,876
But go on.

301
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:28,129
Sheldon, this date
is probably my one chance with Penny.

302
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,630
What happens if I blow it?

303
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:34,677
Well, if we accept your premise and also
accept the highly improbable assumption...

304
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:37,430
...that Penny is the only woman
in the world for you...

305
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,391
...we can logically conclude
that the result of blowing it...

306
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,811
...would be that you end up a lonely,
bitter old man with no progeny.

307
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:46,397
The image of any number
of evil lighthouse keepers...

308
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,900
...from Scooby-Doo cartoons
comes to mind.

309
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:50,985
You're not helping.

310
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,945
All right, what response on my part...

311
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:55,406
...would bring this conversation
to a conclusion?

312
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,159
Tell me whether or not
to go through with the date.

313
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,744
Schrödinger's cat.

314
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,955
Wow, that's brilliant.

315
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,750
You sound surprised.

316
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,212
Mmm.

- Hi.
- Hi.

319
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,276
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

320
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:34,779
You look very nice.

321
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,447
Thank you. So do you.

00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,787
I made an 8:00 reservation.

324
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,248
Okay, yeah, great. Listen...

325
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,333
Maybe we should talk first.

326
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,377
Oh.

327
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,711
Okay.

328
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:56,050
But before you say anything,
have you ever heard of Schrödinger's cat?

329
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,140
Actually, I've heard
far too much about Schrödinger's cat.

330
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,433
Good.

331
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,317
All right, the cat's alive.
Let's go to dinner.
